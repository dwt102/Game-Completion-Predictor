Portal 2,"Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed by Valve Corporation and released on April 19, 2011 on Steam, PS3 and Xbox 360. It was published by Valve Corporation in digital form and by Electronic Arts in physical form. 

Its plot directly follows the first game's, taking place in the Half-Life universe. You play as Chell, a test subject in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate her...

Portal 2's core mechanics are very similar to the first game's ; the player must make their way through several test chambers which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing, yet still feature profound gameplay. The sequel adds several new puzzle elements, such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when running on them.

The game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable dialogue and writing and its aesthetic. Both games in the series are responsible for inspiring most puzzle games succeeding them, particularly first-person puzzle games. The series, its characters and even its items such as the portal gun and the companion cube have become a cultural icon within gaming communities.

God of War (2018),"It is a new beginning for Kratos. Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, he ventures into the brutal Norse wilds with his son Atreus, fighting to fulfill a deeply personal quest. 

His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive… And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series—satisfying combat; breathtaking scale; and a powerful narrative—and fuses them anew. 

Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son. 

From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore every inch of God of War’s breathtakingly threatening landscape—by far the largest in the franchise. 

With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling.

Hollow Knight,"Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania-type game developed by an indie studio named Team Cherry.

Most of the game's story is told through the in-world items, tablets, and thoughts of other characters. Many plot aspects are told to the player indirectly or through the secret areas that provide a bit of lore in addition to an upgrade. At the beginning of the game, the player visits a town of Dirtmouth. A town built above the ruins of Hallownest. The players descend down into the ruins to find some answers to his questions.

The game revolves mainly around the exploration of the in-game world, which requires the players to have some platforming skills. The players have to find secrets that are scattered around the level and battle their enemies. There is a certain degree of backtracking in the game as some areas are locked until the player defeats a certain boss or picks up a specific item. Each area changes as the plot advances so it may be surprising to come back in a certain area.

The laboratory is destroyed as well as the facility itself, as unknown creatures like Vortigaunts are now everywhere in the facility. Gordon must battle his way to the surface and find a way to close the portal.

One of the main features of Half-Life was story-telling through scripted sequences within the actual gameplay. Without having cutscenes, the game was able to tell the full story of the game by showing scripted deaths, dialogues, character appearance while the gameplay was moving one.

Carrying his severed head, Senua sets out to Helheim, the underworld of the dead, to bring her lover's soul back. Her grim and bloody journey mirrors her descent into madness. It becomes increasingly difficult for her (and, thus, the player) to tell fact from fantasy, as she hears voices in her head and sees hallucinations. 

When not fighting her enemies, Senua has to solve puzzles to move forward. This is where her distorted perception actually comes out handy, enabling her to ""focus"" and see what regular people can not. The ghostly voices, recorded using the binaural method to create an eery effect, also help to guide Senua or to warn her about dangers.

Survivors can form one- to six-person Tribes with the options to choose Unofficial and Official (Ranked) servers, and a variety of game-lengths and sizes in which to play. Players will start in the base forest environment introduced in the original ARK: Survival Evolved, with new environments and creatures introduced as the game evolves. Dedicated eSport ranking, matchmaking, reward, and tournament features make ARK: SotF readily accessible to all players.

Balanced for intense competition, contestants begin in a neutral staging area where they can communicate pre-game, strategize, or talk trash. After a count-down, they dramatically descend from the sky onto the ARK in a circular formation via beams of light. There is a cache of valuable items in the center – do survivors dash for the goods and fight it out, do they run into the forest and hide, search for Dinosaurs to rapidly build their army, or do they freeze up from the sheer terror of death? A continually shrinking “ring of death” forces contestants ever closer together over time. The hunt is on!

Middle-earth: Shadow of War,"Middle-earth: Shadow of War is a continuation of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor
The game operates on the world and the characters of the books of JRR Tolkien. However, it will be more accurate to say that the game is closer to the cinematic version of this story, created by director Peter Jackson. This is noticeable both in the visual solutions of some locations, and in the events themselves and their location in time relative to each other.

Judging by the events, the game takes place between the events of the books ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"". However, in the game there are also such events as the fall of the city-fortress of Minas Ithil and its transformation into Minas Morgul - in books these events occur several thousand years earlier.

As in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, in the game Middle-earth: Shadow of War, the Nemesis system operates. This system provides a change in the world of the game and its inhabitants from the actions of the player. Therefore, each passage differs from other passages. For the game Middle-earth: Shadow of War, the Nemesis system has been improved.

If the player has the game Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, he can transfer to Middle-earth: Shadow of War some characters from the previous game - one enemy and one ally.

You can also craft items like tools, weapons, and armor. There's an option to shift to the first or the third person view.
Minecraft includes multiple modes that dramatically change the focus of the game. Survival and Adventure modes require the player to gather resources, hunt for food and fight monsters to survive. In the Hardcore mode, there’s even permanent death. Creative mode, by contrast, offers you to freely explore the world and construct whatever you want with unlimited resources. There’s also a multiplayer mode that allows the players to share their worlds and engage in the traditional MMO activities, such as player-vs-player combat.

ARK: Survival Evolved,"As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape!
Dinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!
You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!
By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.
Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!
By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.
Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!
All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new ""Engrams"" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D ""Explorer Notes"". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!
Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!
The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.
On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.
You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer.

Undertale,"Undertale is an independent role-playing game developed by Toby Fox.

Once upon a time, there were two races on Earth: monsters and humans, but a war broke out between them and the latter won. Seven greatest mages sealed the monsters underground and left one entrance through a hole in the Ebott mountain. A lot of time passed since the war, but a human child accidentally falls down the mountain. Its goal is to get back out.

Undertale uses pixelated graphics and traditional mechanics of RPGs such as earning experience points, having an open world, and so on. As the game goes on, the player has to solve several puzzles and interact with NPCs. The battles in the game are represented using the bullet hell mini-games with the player having an option to choose where they want to spare their opponent or hit the enemy back.

Although having more than one playable character, Trine successfully uses all three of them. Amadeus as the mage is able to move objects or create boxes and planks to help overcome some obstacles. Zoya is very agile so she can hook and grapple on some surfaces, or shoot different targets.

They are trying to save the magical forest after the dark spirit Kuro stole the heart of the tree of life, what made the forest began to wither rapidly, losing its vitality: the water becomes dirty, the trees cease to bloom and bear fruit, and the woodland is covered with thick thorns.

A distinct new feature in the sixth part is that city improvements are no more concentrated in each city's only main tile. Instead, they are distributed throughout its whole surrounding area. Each of them is now considered a ""district"" with a specific purpose, and some of them should be built only on specific terrain. Similarly, wonders now occupy tiles on their own. Technology tree was also modified to take into account the player's terrain improvements that may speed up the research of certain technologies.

The gameplay is based on exploration and puzzle solving. There's no combat, and you are meant to avoid enemies and act stealthily. To progress through the story, you need to search for clues, read multiple notes and solve puzzles.   
Though there are monsters in SOMA, it frightens with its atmosphere in the first place. A dark, abandoned station with dead people, uncertainty and the lack of any understanding of what is waiting for you is scarier than screamers and blood rivers.

The day is different from the night in everything. During the day we equip the shelter, repair and produce weapons and tools - from what can be found. In the afternoon we communicate with neighbours, sometimes with benefit. At night we go out for prey. The night harbours us but also harbours looters, often they are armed. Winter brings cold and freezes water, requires more health and firewood.
Decisions that have to be made often have a moral dimension - can one rob an unarmed person if this is a matter of life and death for someone from the group?

Most of the game has the player re-enacting Silas's presumed past, while in the present the hero is narrating his own story off-screen. Silas is an unreliable narrator, however, and his own in-game audience will point at plot holes in his tall tales.

The protagonist will escape prison, wander the Wild West, fight brigands and other enemies using a variety of late XIX century firearms, and occasionally sing country songs.

The abilities are designed using the rock-paper-scissors principle with each ability serving as a counter to another. This was done in order to put emphasis on a player's skill and not the chosen character. The game also features character customization system which allows changing the look of any selected champion.

There is no loadout system in the game whatsoever. Players have to pick up the weapons scattered on the map.

Players can download the game for free, yet they will have access to only one Champion, Ranger. The players have to either rent new champions using the in-game currency or by the so-called champions pack that will unlock every in-game character for an unlimited amount of time.",,2,"['Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'First-Person', 'Horror', 'FPS', 'Gore', 'Difficult', 'Violent', 'Free to Play', 'Online multiplayer', 'Early Access', 'exclusive', 'Fast-Paced', 'true exclusive', 'Arena Shooter', 'e-sports']",['Steam'],Mature,"['id Software', 'Saber Interactive']",['Bethesda Softworks'],2025-04-25T12:40:26,"{'yet': 392, 'owned': 6001, 'beaten': 97, 'toplay': 17, 'dropped': 630, 'playing': 49}"

Dead Cells,"Dead Cells is a roguelike adventure title developed by Motion Twin.

###Story
Not much story is present in the game, as only bits of any information are given out to the players. The game takes place at a remote island, where the players take place of the Prisoner. The Prisoner does not speak, yet he can express confusion and frustration using his body language. The Prisoner is basically immortal, as, in case of death, his head disconnects itself from the Prisoner's body, and gets back to the game's starting area. 

###Gameplay
The game's heavily inspired by The Binding of Isaac, as stated by the developers.

Dead Cells features the procedurally generated environments that are typical for roguelike games, yet it puts a strong emphasis on exploration that is typically found in metroidvanias.

The players set out to explore the island where a prison was built. As the players come down into the dungeons of the island, they find various loot, fight dangerous creatures, collect armor, abilities, and power-ups. Upon death, the players lose all the loot they had on them. It is possible to find a shopkeep somewhere in the dungeons to purchase new equipment or have some rest. 

The game uses death as a learning experience, as it randomizes the placement of enemies, so the players can't take multiple attempts to complete a level. The developers want the player to examine the enemy behavior and learn how to combat the enemies themselves.",88.0,10,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Cloud', 'Atmospheric', 'Great Soundtrack', 'RPG', '2D', 'Difficult', 'Pixel Graphics', 'Early Access', 'Hack and Slash', 'Replay Value', 'Side Scroller', 'Roguelike', 'Metroidvania', 'Roguelite', 'Procedural Generation', 'Perma Death']","['Steam', 'GOG', 'Nintendo Store', 'Xbox Store', 'PlayStation Store', 'itch.io', 'App Store', 'Epic Games']",Teen,"['Plug In Digital', 'Playdigious', 'Motion Twin']","['Plug In Digital', 'Playdigious', 'Motion Twin']",2025-05-26T05:30:37,"{'yet': 380, 'owned': 4269, 'beaten': 758, 'toplay': 552, 'dropped': 820, 'playing': 390}"
"Papers, Please","The creator of the game often travelled through Asia and made the observation that the work of an immigration officer checking documents for entry is simultaneously very monotonous and very responsible. The game reproduces this work - but scammers and unusual situations occur in it much more often than in reality. The task of the player-officer is not to make a mistake, not to let an unwanted guest into the country. He has power, directories, translucent devices, etc., but experienced masters of deception and fraud act against him. The task of the player is complicated by the fact that his country is like all the paranoid dictatorships at the same time.

The game gives few nods towards some other known franchises as Warhammer, Warcraft or even Star Wars.

Gaming process is very complicated. Having no character class as it is, every mage can create his unique combinations from eight different types of magic - water, life, shield, cold, lightning, arcane, earth and fire. Some of them are not compatible such as fire and cold because of their opposing nature, but the game deeply explores the way to create a unique gameplay-style based on your preference.

Resident Evil 4 (2005),"Resident Evil 4 is a third-person shooter game developed by Capcom Production Studio 4 and published by Capcom. The sixth major installment in the Resident Evil series, it was originally released for the GameCube in 2005. Players control U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president's daughter Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe, Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite, and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.
Development began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments, the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.
Resident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but was ported to numerous formats, becoming a cross-platform hit, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, voice acting, and characters, and is often named one of the best video games, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the ""over-the-shoulder"" third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.

#Gameplay
The player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series' previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.
Resident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a ""finishing move"" on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game's many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.
The main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (""The Cattle"" in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.
The inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.
Capcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is ""Separate Ways"", a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong's involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series' villain Albert Wesker. ""Ada's Report"", a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada's relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames ""The Mercenaries"" and ""Assignment Ada"" (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.

#Plot
U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President's daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.
While in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a ""sample"" once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.
After killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler's henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar's traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley's infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon's hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.
Afterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary's intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser's fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada's help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.",83.0,5,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Cloud', 'Atmospheric', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Third Person', 'Sci-fi', 'Horror', 'Gore', 'Difficult', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Classic', 'Survival', 'Third-Person Shooter', 'Zombies', 'Survival Horror', 'Captions available', 'Replay Value', 'Remake', 'Quick-Time Events', 'Inventory Management', 'first person shooter', 'tank controls', 'survival-horror-game']","['Google Play', 'PlayStation Store', 'App Store', 'Steam']",Mature,['Capcom'],"['Ubisoft Entertainment', 'Capcom', 'THQ', '1C-SoftClub', 'Nintendo Australia', 'Red Ant Enterprises']",2025-05-23T19:41:45,"{'yet': 330, 'owned': 4274, 'beaten': 1683, 'toplay': 256, 'dropped': 307, 'playing': 68}"

The game develops between three points in the biography of the girl Jodie Holmes. In these three points, we find ourselves repeatedly. And in general, we see 16 years of her life, from 8 to 24 years.
Jodie from birth has a gift of communication with a disembodied being called Aiden. In this context, the Jodie-Aiden couple can capture people's consciousness, move objects, and even strangle people. At the same time, Jodie is periodically exposed to attacks of vague energies.
Her parents are not her relatives, they give her to psychiatrists and refuse her. When the family of one of the psychiatrists perishes, Jodie, with the help of Ayden, establishes a connection with the deceased, she can let the living and the dead speak.
The CIA is interested in Jodie's abilities and makes her become an agent. She then instructs her on several missions, but Jodie realises that she is being used for criminal activities - and refuses to cooperate with the CIA. CIA agents do not leave her alone, and she destroys them.
The game has a lot of interpretations of what is happening in the world of the dead, different people use Jodi's forces in different ways.

Key Features
The player-driven story RPG: In keeping with the Obsidian tradition, how you approach The Outer Worlds is up to you. Your choices affect not only the way the story develops; but your character build, companion stories, and end game scenarios.

You can be flawed, in a good way: New to The Outer Worlds is the idea of flaws. A compelling hero is made by the flaws they carry with them. While playing The Outer Worlds, the game tracks your experience to find what you aren't particularly good at. Keep getting attacked by Raptidons? Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious creatures, but rewards you with an additional character perk immediately. This optional approach to the game helps you build the character you want while exploring Halcyon.

Lead your companions: During your journey through the furthest colony, you will meet a host of characters who will want to join your crew. Armed with unique abilities, these companions all have their own missions, motivations, and ideals. It's up to you to help them achieve their goals, or turn them to your own ends.

POSTAL 2,"Like original Postal, its sequel was specifically intended to spark controversy. The game is full of gross violence, black humor, obscenities, and biting satire of American life. The plot follows Postal Dude, a typical ""white trash"" and a small town trailer-park dweller, as he is given menial daily tasks, such as buying milk. The way he completes them, however, is what makes Postal 2 one of the most censored and offensive games ever. At the various points of the game, the player may piss over his opponents, use cats as gun silencers (by literally showing your gun up the cat's anus), burn dogs alive, blow up cars (but not drive them, in Postal 2 cars are simply four-wheeled explosives), shoot people and flip them a bird. The game, however, is just as violent as the player wants it to be. Most missions can be accomplished without killing, though it would have spoiled all the fun.
The gameplay has changed since the previous part. Isometric view from the original was replaced with the first-person view. The world around Postal Dude is living by itself, regardless of the player’s presence, much like in Grand Theft Auto series.

Frostpunk,"In an ultimately frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. The city ruler has to manage both the inhabitants and the infrastracture the citizens live in. Leader’s tactical skills face challenges, frequently questioning morality and the basic foundation of what we consider an organized society. Here optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.
What decisions will you make so the society can survive? What will you do when pushed to the limits? And...
...who will you become in the process?

THE CITY MUST SURVIVE
Frostpunk is a city-survival game where heat means life and every decision comes with a cost.

MAINTAIN THE HOPE
Survival is about hope and will to live. Your ability to spark and maintain these two in your people will be a determinant factor for success.

MAKE THE LAW
Society is a group of people abiding the same rules and sharing similar beliefs. Establishing laws and customs will be a crucial factor shaping your society.

WEIGHT YOUR CHOICES
Will you allow child-labour? How will you treat the sick and wounded? Frostpunk challenges a player’s tactical skills, while questioning one’s morality.

EXPLORE
The world covers not only bits of the past but also the potential means to secure the future of your people.

The world of Dear Esther is far from open, and you can only follow the restricted pathways. To unlock all the achievements and find every audio clip, however, may require several walkthroughs.

The characters eventually uncover the dark secrets of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus as a biological weapon, and fight its monsters, such as the Tyrant.

###Gameplay

Battlefield V,"Battlefield V is the sixteenth game in its franchise. 

###Plot
Like the original Battlefield, the game is based on the real events of World War II. The game focuses on the obscure battles of the war. It features storylines that tie the battles together and consist of episodes called “war stories”.

###Gameplay
Battlefield V puts a strong emphasis on realism. The game avoids video game abstractions in favor of immersive experience of the war. For that goal, the game aims to increase the player's interaction with the environment, such as doors, vehicles, or ammo. The ammo and other resources in the game are scarce, forcing the player to use a tactical approach.
The game gives a spotlight to women in the military who are among the main characters in the campaign. The player might also choose to play a female character in the multiplayer, as the gender is not tied to a class. The game also allows the players many customization options for costumes, vehicles, and weapons.

###Modes
Battlefield V has many multiplayer modes, some of which are new to the series and some are reimagined versions of the modes from previous games. For example, The Grand Operations mode is based on the original Battlefield mode called Operations. This mode imitates a military campaign and consists of a series of battles with different objectives and non-linear progress options.",77.0,5,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'Full controller support', 'Atmospheric', 'Open World', 'First-Person', 'FPS', 'Female Protagonist', 'Violent', 'Action-Adventure', 'PvP', 'War', 'Historical', 'combat', 'Military', 'Online PvP', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Destruction', 'World War II', 'LGBTQ+', 'Battle Royale', 'ww2']","['Steam', 'PlayStation Store', 'Xbox Store']",Mature,"['Electronic Arts', 'Electronic Arts DICE', 'Uprise']",['Electronic Arts'],2025-05-26T06:59:16,"{'yet': 212, 'owned': 3314, 'beaten': 575, 'toplay': 211, 'dropped': 464, 'playing': 129}"

He calls himself an inventor, but his ability to invent is very doubtful, like his successes in life in general. He lives in the home of his ex-girlfriend and does not do anything useful.

The game uses the Unity graphics engine and is available on Steam for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and OS X.

###Game mechanics
There are no conditions for victory or defeat in the game. Each time players simply spawn on the playing field, where they can interact freely with game figures and pieces. All the craziness occurs within the realistic physical model, which the developers have added for greater similarity to the real prototypes. In addition to the insanity that can be arranged in multiplayer along with ten other players, the game engine supports the ability to use preset rules for different board games and thus play them.

###Key features
There are several games included. For example, chess, poker, and checkers. The set is small, but the game supports Steam Workshop and the ability to download your own models of figures and game boards.

###Gameplay
The point of the game is to conquer as many planets as possible using the given resources. The protagonist can be chosen out of three races: industrials, aliens and psychics each with unique special abilities.
The gameplay process occurs exclusively in online mode, but single battles and succeeds against enemy AI is possible too. However, the campaign as a whole cannot be played offline. 

###Key features
As in usual RTS, the gameplay is centered around resource management — the title's economy consists of prices on Metal, Credits, and Crystal — each with the individual gain conditions. So it would be impossible for instance to sell all of your metal to the friendly guild — after the wholesale, stock prices decrease and economy shifts towards them like real-life one.
While exploring the world, the player may stumble across habitable planets and anomalies which prevent the player from getting to the goal. Anomalies include asteroids, hostile environment, and ice fields.

###Gameplay
Deponia is a point-and-click adventure set on the planet of the same name. The game features 2,5D gameplay which means there are layers to the static background.

The title features multiple hints if the player finds himself stuck at the level. Hints can be turned off.

###Story
The story derives from the planet Deponia, the population of which were forced to move to the city called Elysium leaving Deponia as dumpster behind them and considering all its inhabitants to be dead.
The player follows a story of Rufus who is eager to follow the quest of his father's life and reach Deponia.

Deathmatch Classic,"Deathmatch Classic is a standalone Half-Life mod developed by Valve.

Deathmatch Classic was initially developed as a remake of a popular game by Id Software, Quake.

The initial release included five maps, which were ported from Quake. The gameplay closely resembles the same of Quake with minor differences in weaponry. For instance, the iconic Half-Life crowbar is used instead of Quake's axe.

Deathmatch Classic physics is similar to Quake and allows the players to traverse at high speeds using bunnyhopping because of game engines similarities. However, the game speed in Deathmatch Classic is slower than in Quake. 

There is no loadout system in the game, so the players have to pick up weapons that are scattered across the map and vary from the default shotgun to a rocket launcher, a taser, and a powerful beam weaponry. 

There are also three kinds of bonuses in the game which grant players special abilities such as invincibility, invisibility or quad damage for a short amount of time.",,1,"['Multiplayer', 'cooperative', 'First-Person', 'Sci-fi', 'FPS', 'Classic', 'Valve Anti-Cheat enabled', 'Arena Shooter']",['Steam'],,['Valve Software'],['Valve'],2025-01-14T01:10:49,"{'yet': 212, 'owned': 4078, 'beaten': 56, 'toplay': 7, 'dropped': 132, 'playing': 3}"

Gameplay in Bully is reminiscent of that in Grand Theft Auto games (made by the same Rockstar Games), albeit on a smaller scale. You, as Jimmy, walk around an open world of Bullworth Academy and its surroundings, finding new optional missions that may get you into trouble and fun at the same time. You can pick fights with other hooligans, fire at your schoolmates with a slingshot, drop stink bombs, ride a skateboard, and break into others’ lockers, as long as you don’t get caught by the teachers. You will also attend classes and perform exercises, which are rendered as mini-games. A smaller world, compared to GTA, means fewer characters, but each major character is interactive, fleshed out, and unique.

This is a setting. We meet the hero pursuing his own tasks - he is looking for treasure in a dungeon under someone else's order. But instead of gold and gems, he discovers a device of an incomprehensible purpose. The hero contacts the customer and receives an order to blow up the found structure. The explosion leads to the awakening of a race of monsters, like giant insects, which begin to briskly destroy the colonists. And the hero now has to kill the monsters.

Sunset Overdrive,"2027, the metropolis of Sun City.

The city is full of creatures, savage, aggressive and insane - these creatures were just ordinary townspeople a short while ago, but they abused the energy drink produced by Fizzco, in which something was wrong with the recipe. In general, loyal consumers mutated into monsters and now nothing can be done with them, only to kill everyone.

The protagonist (by the way, who worked at Fizzco) is not constrained by any laws of physics, can move around the city in any direction, run on walls and wires, jump like a kangaroo and so on. This is not parkour, it's just complete freedom of movement. He also has a ""guidance system"" that shows him the way.

In addition to the hero, several groups and singles of varying degrees of eccentricity are fighting monsters in the city. Monsters also do not belong to the same type. Monsters are many, they are very different and extremely unusual - there are, for example, creatures fused with water cannons or a bucket from an excavator. The hero's weapon is even more diverse than the monsters. Various weapons rush vinyl records, throw bowling balls, shoot teddy bears with pieces of TNT in their paws and this is not the whole list.

###Gameplay
The game is experienced in the third person, ""behind-the-shoulder"" view. One of the title's main attractions is the auteur game design by Shinji Mikami who inspired both games of the series.
His style mixes absurdist plots, dark, horror movie-like environments, and almost absent jumpscares. The player must explore the vast maps in search of clues, collectibles, and story-related events. The game is highly non-linear and allows completing mandatory missions whenever one likes it. The time between the quests may be spent on crafting materials out of available resources, completing side quests and develop Sebastian Castellanos' — the protagonist's — abilities. There is a total of five skill trees each corresponding to playstyle and physical characteristics.

###Plot

The narrative circles around the presumable death of the policeman's daughter and the opportunities that she is not dead yet.

Some of the new monsters are also based on the local folklore.

Unlike all previous games in its series, Fallout 76 features no human NPCs (although robots and monsters are present). Instead, the game delivers the story through records and environment. Some of Fallout series famous mechanics return in Fallout 76. The character creation is based on a modified version of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of abilities and perks.

###Gameplay
The game combines platforming, parkour, and puzzles in the vein of Portal series. The player controls Faith from the first person view as she runs and leaps across the rooftops of Glass. Puzzle-like level design requires her to use pipes, wires, and ledges to get to her destination. Precision timing is important to perform jumps, slides, and rushes in a seamless flow.

The combat system in Catalyst changed dramatically. Unlike in the original game, Faith cannot use guns. She can fight in hand-to-hand combat but usually has to avoid enemies.

Prototype,"New York, Manhattan Peninsula (very detailed), our days. The townspeople are struck by a mutation that turns people into bloodthirsty monsters.

Abilities are very useful to him, because he will have to stop the epidemic and at the same time hide from the army, police and mercenaries.

###Plot
Alex comes to the senses in Ghentec's morgue, located in its Manhattan headquarters. Apparently, the reason for his awakening was the noise produced by mercenaries of the organization Blackwatch, trying to break open the doors of this headquarters.

Alex tries to hide, run away. The mercenaries try to stop him, but Alex discovers in himself one by one amazing abilities - he is not harmed by bullets, he can jump high, throw heavy objects, run on the walls of buildings. And he can ""absorb"" people, taking their appearance and gaining knowledge about everything that the absorbed people know and remember. For example, after the takeover of one of the commanders of Blackwatch, Alex finds out that he has a sister.

Alex finds his sister and learns from her (this time without absorption) that he was an important employee of the company, at the headquarters of which we met him at the beginning of the game. Alex's job duties included working with biological weapons.

During the game, the army and the police consider Alex guilty of creating and spreading the virus, Blackwatch pursues Alex for other reasons, and Alex himself tries to stop the mutants and other opponents with all the power of their super abilities. Soon it turns out that among these superpowers there is the ability to turn his body into almost anything, including weapons, shield and armor.

###Gameplay

All of Manhattan from the very beginning of the game is open for the game. Outside of Manhattan, however, you can not get out. The player can follow the story, and can perform separate missions. Due to the presence of super abilities, the hero can move both horizontally and on walls. But not as an insect, but just running. Falling from the height does not hurt Alex, so he can use this trick to defeat opponents - literally falling on their heads.
  
Alex can jump very high, and manage to plan in the air.

Alex fights, using the ability of his body to transform. His hands can turn into sledgehammers, blades, whips or shields. He can instantly increase the volume of his body's muscles to increase their strength - in normal mode, such a mass would have prevented him, so he does not wear all these muscles all the time. His skin can be turned into armor. He can also see in the dark and distinguish mutants from normal people by eyes.

All abilities can also be improved as you progress in the game and perform various tasks.

The players are free to explore Kazakh City in order to obtain new abilities and equipment. There are also several pickups scattered across the level. The pickups were intended to be found and collected rather than being temporary bonuses.

The game will force you through dozens of increasingly difficult time-moves-only-when-you-move gameplay challenges.

As you unlock powerful abilities and gain access to new playable characters, so will your enemies grow stronger, smarter and more desperate to stop you.
Come and join the fray. Play in Early Access. Let the system learn from you.SUPERHOT rogue-like expansion early access hype! What to expect now?
We’re still a good 9-12 months away from a full release, so please don’t forget that this is nowhere close to a complete, satisfying experience just yet. The current build of MIND CONTROL DELETE is the first time we’re inviting you to check out a few of the brand new gameplay systems that are going to be central to the game:
First 2 playable MINDS, each with it’s own unique ability and gameplay modifiers
A kaleidoscope of the first dozen new gameplay levels that mix into the first few dozen combat challenges
New animation and AI systems to drive new weapons, abilities, and enemy types
Hitpoint system and power-up store to give you that extra oompf needed to crush your enemies and see them driven before you
Procedural rogue-like run generation baked into the core gameplay loop, enabling us to tell longer, more complex stories and deliver tons more of satisfying skill-based gameplay
Beware though - this is an extremely early, bleeding-edge version of most of those systems. The limitations for this early access build are not for the faint of heart:
No story whatsoever - we don’t want to spoil too much too quickly so this and the next few updates will be all about gameplay features
No advanced power-ups or new enemy types enabled yet - we want to establish and test the balance of vanilla gameplay in this build, waiting to sprinkle in gamebreaking modifiers and new foes to beat up until future updates
No replay or point system - easy bragging about your insane skills will need to wait
Absolutely no hidden menu minigames yet - we have so many new cool ones coming out super soon tho <3
If you’re not looking for an incomplete game that’s in constant flux and relies on your feedback and creativity to expand, or if you’d rather just play a finished experience that’s guaranteed to challenge and satisfy you and your deepest power fantasies, then we totally recommend you should wait until MIND CONTROL DELETE is out of early access.
However, if you’re super brave and want to help guide the development in its earliest stages, then go ahead - join us, and get your name in the credits!Why are you putting MIND CONTROL DELETE in early access in the first place tho?
We released the original SUPERHOT in February 2016 after nearly two years of intense creative crunch. The amazing support during the development from our Kickstarter backers and the exhilarating reaction we got from you once the game released was simply mind blowing.
With morale at an all-time high, we immediately jumped into a flurry of prototyping and refining gameplay and story concepts that we weren’t able to fit into the original game. We tested and put a bunch of them to work in virtual reality, and after releasing SUPERHOT VR to even more outstanding support from you guys, we finally had a road map for the first non-VR expansion ironed out in December 2016. In our usual no-compromise approach to design, we made that roadmap way more ambitious than originally anticipated and we decided to make the expansion a fully standalone game, allowing us to rewrite and reimagine all of our major gameplay systems.
The single most important strength of the original SUPERHOT was the amazing involvement of tens of thousands of creative alpha and beta testers that helped us shape and balance the game and drove us to pursue zero compromises in design. After over a year of work on MIND CONTROL DELETE, we’re now ready to start this adventure together again. We’re inviting you to jump in and co-create the game with us. Talk to us, work with us, and let’s build the build the biggest SUPERHOT yet together.What’s the price tag on this? Is this that free DLC you were talking about?
Yup! Way bigger than the usual free DLC though, so it'll take a bit longer to release. If you own the original SUPERHOT on Steam now or buy it while MIND CONTROL DELETE is still in Early Access, you’ll get the full expansion for free once it’s finished and released.
However if you can’t wait to work with us, and you feel like bravely facing rough edges and helping shape the game as it develops, then we’ll be thrilled to have you sign your name to a piece of SUPERHOT history and join us in Early Access right now.
Once MIND CONTROL DELETE releases in earnest, it will be priced same as the other SUPERHOT games for everyone who’s still new to the franchise.FAQ
Should I buy MIND CONTROL DELETE if I haven’t played the original SUPERHOT?
Not right now. The game will be a totally standalone experience in a few updates, but the lack of clear structure and story right now would be confusing for newcomers. Definitely get the original SUPERHOT though. It’s lots of fun.
What’s the update roadmap?
We’re new to Early Access, but we’re hoping to use your feedback and collaboration to drive and guide the development. We have a bunch of large features already in the pipeline that we’ll be dropping on livestream updates every few weeks, starting with the first major content update dropping in January, and following with balance and feature updates released on a monthly / bi-monthly schedule.
I really want X in the game, how do I make you want to do X too?

Overlord II,"This sequel to the comic dark fantasy Overlord allows the player to have fun being evil. You play as the dark Overlord who leads his armies of minions against the human Glorious Empire (which obviously mimics the real-world Roman Empire). The Glorious Empire is not ""good"" anyway: its leaders are trying to eliminate all magic users, so the ""evil"" motivation is quite justified. However, to accomplish his conquest and become a truly powerful and feared dark lord, you will have to commit some really vile deeds. One of your first missions, for example, involves slaughtering baby seals.
The game follows the Overlord from his childhood, as he grows from a nasty kid to a mighty dark knight that looks a lot like Sauron as shown in The Fellowship of the Ring movie. The Overlord begins his conquest with a pack of goblins and a single troll, but over time his minions will develop into more powerful and deadly creatures and attack the enemy in large hordes. The game does not turn into a strategy, however, as you still only directly control the dark lord himself, and the minions are commanded through his orders.  Overlord II is famous for its humor: the game does not take itself too seriously. There are all sorts of puns and parodies on the stereotypical villains and other fantasy tropes, such as elves and fairies. Goblin minions squeak, cringe and fall, while playful Danny-Elfman-esque music is echoing in the background.",79.0,2,"['Singleplayer', 'Multiplayer', 'Atmospheric', 'RPG', 'Open World', 'Third Person', 'Fantasy', 'Funny', 'Comedy', 'Action-Adventure', 'Action RPG', 'Dark Fantasy', 'RTS', 'Magic', 'Dark Humor', 'Villain Protagonist']","['Xbox Store', 'Steam', 'Xbox 360 Store', 'GOG']",Teen,"['Triumph Studios', 'Virtual Programming']",['Codemasters'],2025-04-18T20:07:12,"{'yet': 205, 'owned': 3164, 'beaten': 258, 'toplay': 56, 'dropped': 159, 'playing': 4}"

The most valuable thing Yarni finds is memories. Memories of a family of people, from which he ""comes"" himself.

Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator,"The Game:
Here is a sandbox like no other. Create massive battles with absolutely no limits. Want to see 10,000 chickens fight an army of Romans?? Sure, why not. Want to see a company of WW2 U.S soldiers fight 11,000 Medieval soldiers?? There are simply no limits to the carnage you can achieve in Epic Battle Simulator. Mess around with a massive variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units looks like? We don't recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!
The Technology:
Unfortunately there really aren't many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it's true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it's surroundings and effects the overall lighting.
Yes I worked hard to bring this game to life, may you all inflict carnage upon it!",,1,"['Singleplayer', 'Atmospheric', 'Open World', 'First-Person', 'Third Person', 'Fantasy', 'Funny', 'Gore', 'Sandbox', 'Survival', 'Comedy', 'Violent', 'Early Access', 'Zombies', 'War', 'Medieval', 'Memes']",['Steam'],,['Brilliant Game Studios'],['Brilliant Game Studios'],2025-04-30T23:38:19,"{'yet': 138, 'owned': 3539, 'beaten': 22, 'toplay': 12, 'dropped': 110, 'playing': 4}"

Project Zomboid,"The game combines the genres of survival horror and role-playing game. The main theme of the game - survival during a zombie apocalypse.

It has an open and changing world, many opportunities for the manufacture of useful things and cooperation with other characters, to fight hunger, injuries, depression and paranoia.

###Plot
The game takes place in Knox County, Kentucky, USA.

As a result of the epidemic, a huge part of the population of the district became infected with an unknown virus and turned into a zombie. The few survivors will have to fight for survival.

The player plays as one of the survivors. The game does not have any definite ending, it cannot be won and it will end when the player’s character dies - and it depends only on him how late it will happen.

###Gameplay
The game begins with the creation of a character.

The player can choose the name, gender, race, hairstyle, initial clothing, as well as the presence of a beard and chest hair in a male character.

Then begins the creation of character and part of the background of the character. You can choose the character's profession before the apocalypse. Subsequently, this will affect some of the skills (for example, a former policeman shoots better, a builder builds defenses better, nurses heal wounds more successfully, cooks cook better, etc.).

You can then choose the positive and negative traits of the character. The negative ones include obesity, laziness, poor eyesight, chronic fatigue, constant thirst, etc. For the chosen negative traits you get points - these points can be spent on the positive traits of this character, such as agility, strength, high disease resistance and even luck.

After creating a character, you (or rather, a character) find yourself in a randomly selected house on a game map. The zombie apocalypse has already begun, and your character has to look for a way to survive. In the game, not even very moral ways are allowed to do this: you can loot and rob, you can create a group of honest people and resist both zombies and bandits.

In addition to winning battles, the hero needs food, water, sleep, rest, and fellowship to survive - constant loneliness can lead to depression.

The complexity of the game increases constantly and gradually - the activity of zombies increases, electricity and water supply are turned off, and the products deteriorate. However, the player is able to provide a lot for himself - to cook food on a fire, collect rainwater, grow food.

However, no action can ensure eternal survival - sooner or later the character dies. The slogan at the beginning of each new game is pessimistic: “This is the story of your death.”",,6,"['Singleplayer', 'Multiplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'RPG', 'Co-op', 'Open World', 'cooperative', '2D', 'Partial Controller Support', 'Sandbox', 'Survival', 'Split Screen', 'Early Access', 'Cross-Platform Multiplayer', 'Zombies', 'Survival Horror', 'Post-apocalyptic', 'controller support', 'Crafting', 'Realistic', 'Isometric', 'Building', 'Real-Time with Pause', 'in development']","['Steam', 'GOG']",,['The Indie Stone'],['The Indie Stone'],2025-05-21T11:52:33,"{'yet': 94, 'owned': 3155, 'beaten': 103, 'toplay': 65, 'dropped': 303, 'playing': 90}"

The gameplay of Super Mario Odyssey draws inspiration from Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine. The game consists 17 levels (named as “kingdoms”).

Some moons can be found in different parts of the level or acquired as a reward for completing certain tasks or challenges. The Mario’s moveset mostly resembles that of Super Mario 64 and includes wall jumps, triple jumps, somersaults, long jumps, rolling on the ground.

Deceit,"Deceit is a six-player multiplayer horror game developed by Automaton.

###Gameplay
Deceit is heavily influenced by the Trouble In Terrorist Town Half-Life 2 mod. All six players spawn on a vast map, with several of your group being infected with a virus that allows them to transform in their terror form. The players have to figure out who is infected, kill them or at least attempt an escape. 

Most of the time, the map is lit up by portable lamps and projectors, yet there are blackout periods that last several minutes. During these periods, the infected players can transform into the terror form in which they become faster, stronger, and have night vision. They can only be countered using light. 

For the non-infected players, there are several objectives placed around the map, like turning on the generators, finding light sources or weapons. These objectives both increase the chance of player survival and sometimes allow the players to escape off the map. 

The gameplay heavily relies on its psychological component with the maps being designed in a way to place a seed of doubt in the players' heads. The players have to decide with whom they'd want to stay close to or leave behind. It is necessary to display your intentions correctly, so the game features an emote system, which allows the players who do not have a microphone to interact with the others.",,2,"['Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Co-op', 'Horror', 'FPS', 'Online multiplayer']",['Steam'],,['Automaton'],['Automaton'],2025-04-11T13:14:27,"{'yet': 151, 'owned': 3112, 'beaten': 47, 'toplay': 17, 'dropped': 290, 'playing': 11}"

However, if the Skull Heart is used by a woman with impure intentions, it will control her, turning her into a destructive monster called the Skullgirl. Not once has anyone used the Skull Heart without falling to its curse. The game follows the stories of 14 characters on their way to face the Skullgirl and retrieve the Heart, be it for the greater good or simply their own gain.

The game is a tribute to Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and its mechanics are intended as a more polished version of the classic fighting game title, with some original ideas. In a standard player vs. player match, each player controls one character out a chosen number of one to three characters which they can switch to at any time. They can also call their inactive characters to perform assist attacks. Like most Marvel vs. Capcom-inspired games, Skullgirls is fast-paced and features long, complex combos based on animation cancels. It introduces a burst system which allows players to break their opponent's combo if it becomes too long.

Skullgirls features a 'dark deco'-inspired art style mixed with some horror themes and a jazz and rock soundtrack consisting of 28 tracks. In 2013, the game set the Guinness World Record Gamer's Edition record for most average frames of animation per character in a video game, reaching 1,439 frames per character and 11,515 frames total for its initial eight-character roster.

In February 2013, Skullgirls came in second in a crowdfunding event organized by fighting game website Shoryuken to decide what would be the final game featured on the EVO 2013 line up, with all proceeds sent to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Skullgirls raised over $US 78,000. While it was not featured as an EVO main game, EVO organizers supported the game's side event by providing prize money and advertisement.",81.0,5,"['Singleplayer', 'Multiplayer', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Female Protagonist', 'Anime', 'Competitive', ""Beat 'em up"", 'Hand-drawn', '2D Fighter']","['App Store', 'Nintendo Store', 'Xbox Store', 'Steam', 'Xbox 360 Store']",Teen,['Lab Zero Games'],"['Autumn Games', 'MarvelousAQL']",2025-05-22T23:18:37,"{'yet': 131, 'owned': 3047, 'beaten': 108, 'toplay': 36, 'dropped': 245, 'playing': 31}"

How the government provides these aspects to its residents depends on the level of satisfaction of the population, as each need is different for each resident. If the level of happiness is low, the people can go to the rebels. And when the rebels accumulate a lot, they attack various objects, including the Palace.

The game focuses heavily on combat and features a scoring system named Skillshot. Players gain points for every kill, the more creative the murder is - the more points one gets. Environmental kills are valued the most. Points are used as currency that can be used to upgrade your weapons, buy new ones or get ammunition.

Players can carry three weapons with the assault rifle being the default one and can always be found in one's inventory.

There is no competitive multiplayer in Bulletstorm, but co-op and score attack modes are available.

Overwatch,"###The Legacy
Overwatch is a multiplayer first-person shooter from the company that gave players the saga of Azeroth, Starcraft and the Diablo universe. Despite these releases coming out years ago, they are still alive and actively updated. But the developers at Blizzard wanted something new: the company does not like to experiment with new settings, preferring to transfer existing characters to new genres, worlds, and situations. The exception, perhaps, can only be a game about the three Vikings—The Lost Vikings, but this, too, was a long time ago.

###The story and setting
Anyway, the company Blizzard has approached the development of Overwatch with team-specific meticulousness to details and desire to create an elaborative game universe. The player faces a choice between 21 characters who were part of the elite Overwatch unit. The task of Overwatch soldiers is to protect the Earth from conflicts and external threats. But something goes wrong, and the team of heroes breaks up. Despite the multiplayer bias, the game has a full story, it combines all the characters and maps on which the battle takes place. Since the launch, seven new characters have been added to the hero pool. Blizzard tells the story of the world of Overwatch through their characters: almost everyone has an animated short film, comparable in quality to a full meter from, for example, Pixar.

###Continuous support
The game won the hearts of players around the world immediately after the launch. The figures confirm this fact: more than half a million dollars from sales and more than 40 million players. Overwatch has become an anchor project for Activision Blizzard, and the company continues to develop the project two years later, constantly offering players new maps, new characters, new themed events, and new cosmetic skins.",91.0,41,"['Multiplayer', 'First-Person', 'Sci-fi', 'FPS', 'Funny', 'PvP', '3D', 'Team-Based', 'online', 'hero', 'Hero Shooter', 'Team']","['Nintendo Store', 'PlayStation Store', 'Xbox Store']",Teen,[],"['Activision Blizzard', 'Blizzard Entertainment']",2025-05-22T20:45:30,"{'yet': 45, 'owned': 1685, 'beaten': 522, 'toplay': 81, 'dropped': 723, 'playing': 432}"

The title uses a third-person perspective that makes it look like a classic action game. To protect the Rift, you can not only use different traps and spells but also fight Orcs yourself. If you're killed, you'll respawn near your Rift for a certain score. 
Each trap or spell costs the in-game currency you earn by defeating enemies. At the beginning of the level, you choose up to ten items for the battle. As a rule, all traps only work once and then need some time to recharge. Every item is upgradable; on higher levels, you can also get some boosts that will affect that level only.

LEGO Star Wars - The Complete Saga,"Lego Star Wars: The Video Game is an action-adventure game based on Star Wars set of Lego constructors. This is the first installment in the Lego Star Wars video game series.

Aside from terrain, backgrounds and special effects, all of the in-game objects consist of Lego pieces thus the name.  

###Gameplay 
In each level, you play as a group of characters from the movie and have to complete a specific task. You control only one character at a time while AI commands your teammates, but you can instantly switch between them.
The game also supports multiplayer for two with drop-in/drop-out system so the second player can join you without going back to the main menu. The gameplay mostly consists of solving puzzles, exploring environments for secrets and fighting enemies and bosses. There are many characters to unlock as well as other collectibles.

Slime Rancher,"In the far-distant future, far, far away in space (to be exact, a thousand light-years from the Earth), on the planet Far, Far Range, mega-corporations (they, it turns out, will be with us in the distant future!) discovered the ideal source of income, universal natural resource - Plort.

You can produce almost anything from Plot - from food and household chemicals, to solid alloys and incredibly powerful batteries.

Plort is a concentrated mucus produced by slimes - jelly-like living organisms of various species and characteristics.

Slimes, unfortunately, can not be taken to Earth to breed and receive the right amount of Plort. We have to fly to 'Far, Far Range', to build there something like a ranch for slimes and for all this to hire earthlings. One of these earthlings, the space rancheros, the brave young girl Beatrix LeBeau is the character of the game. The girl (and the player) will fly a thousand light-years in a deep sleep to equip a ranch from a Hobson Twillgers, study the planet's environment, collect, feed and breed slimes.

To get the necessary hints the girl can look for notes of the former owner - they meet on the territory of the ranch, and also communicate via Star Mail with a close friend from the Earth. In conversations with a friend, we learn a lot of things about the former, earthly life of the heroine - this information will be important.

###Gameplay and economics
Slimes need to be fed, and this is important. The rest they will do themselves.
It is necessary to feed them not by anything, but by appropriate products. But slimes will produce a lot of Plort - and Plort can be sold on the market, having received currency - newbucks. For newbucks you can buy equipment for ranches and so on. The world of the game is not known until the end, it is possible and necessary to travel through it, opening up new locations, finding new slimes for the ranch, as well as food for slimes and other new resources.

From different types of slimes you can get hybrids. However, with this you need to be more careful - you can get aggressive evil slimes, which will have to be dissolved with water.

Slimes are quite diverse. Ordinary slimes are generally friendly, but they can be dangerous not because of evil will, but because of some natural features like thorns, emitted radiation or the ability to explode.

Some slimes are more productive than others, they produce more Plort. It is these slimes that are created by hybridization, since it is difficult to find them in a natural environment.

Ordinary slimes sometimes merge into a huge Gordo-slime - inside such organisms there are often valuable resources and other interesting and useful things. To get all this, you need to blow up the Gordo-slime.

###Game modes
Adventure. The world is open for research, there are no serious restrictions. You can develop as you want. You can communicate with other ranchers, carry out their assignments and exchange resources with them. 

Carefree is an adventure mode that goes even easier.

The five-day trial is a mode in which you need to earn as many newbucks as possible in 5 days.

Her Story is about a man who is missing and the player has to focus on searching through databases of various video clips from police interviews with missing man’s wife Hannah Smith, in order to solve a case. 

Her Story is the first game made by Sam Barlow since his departure from Climax Studios. He wanted to create a game which focuses on story. He decided to use live action footage and created a police procedural game. In order to make it as much realistic as possible, Barlow watched lots of real police interviews, by doing so he discovered that there is a lot of ambiguity in those files and he wanted to incorporate that into the game as well.

Explore a fresh new world as – along with many other settlers, mercenaries and treasure hunters - you set foot on a remote island seeping with magic, rumored to be filled with riches and lost secrets. A grand journey filled with mystery follows, as you find yourself in the middle of ever-increasing tensions between the invading settlers and the locals, who are protected by manifestations of the island’s earthly magic in the form of supernatural beings.

With a strong focus on its core RPG identity, GreedFall follows Spider's experience in building intricate worlds filled with mysteries to discover, weaving deep character interactions, and offering players freedom to achieve quests and objectives in many different ways – through combat, as well as diplomacy, deception or stealth.

Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter,"Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter is a detective game created by Frogwares. It is the direct continuation of Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments - another game made by the same studio and is the eighth part of a  series.

###Plot
Five cases are present in the game. These cases are detective stories, that are linked with each other and continue the stories of the previous Sherlock Holmes games. The game follows Sherlock Holmes and his companion, Doctor Watson, and their daily lives solving the mysterious crimes.

There are five different, yet interconnected, criminal cases are available for the players to investigate and solve. Some of these cases continue the story of the previous games.

###Gameplay
The game's gameplay is mostly the same as the same as the previous game, Crimes & Punishments. The game takes the players at the crime scenes, where one examines it, finds clues while using several helping items, such as a magnifying glass, talks to witnesses and suspects, interrogates other characters and interacts with items. There is a mini-game which resembles Holmes' deductive method, which helps the players make an assumption.

Bleeding out Agent 47 tumbles into one of the rooms in an unknown Paris hotel. He passes out and starts hallucinating about his previous contracts. Each of these memories is a single mission that has to be completed by the player.

In contrast to the previous game, the detection can be avoided much more easily. The enemies barely notice the Hitman dressed in someone else's clothing. They can still notice you if you stand in front of a guard for too long or openly carry a knife. Players have a lot of options for killing their target. Environmental kills are now much more common. For example, in one of the missions, the player has to eliminate a target using a pillow. 

The game now features a much more gritty tone. It usually takes place in foggy, rainy or snowy environments.

Of course, such a setting can not be taken seriously, so the game is full of humor and Jurassic Park references.

The game is oriented towards online multiplayer gameplay. The players have to pick one of two teams, Allies or Axis. Both teams can compete in a traditional frag-counting deathmatch mode, a ""king of the hill"" mode, or complete specific objectives to win. Each side has multiple character classes, but most dino classes are on the Axis side, including such spectacular specimens as fast-ambushing Velociraptor, machine-gunning Tyrannosaurus and a Triceratops with a mounted tank turret. While dinosaurs are technically stronger than humans, they have trouble reloading their firearms and can be distracted by an Allied rabbit released on the battlefield.

Crossout,"Crossout is a post-apocalyptic vehicular combat game, where players can create battle machines from scratch.


###Plot
The game is set in the universe of Hard Truck Apocalypse (aka Ex Machina), a game from the same Targem Games developer, and serves as its prequel. The game takes place 20 years after an apocalyptic event called Crossout. In 2027 a viral disease pandemic swept across the Earth, driving most people insane. Some committed suicide, some died when nuclear bombs were set off. Many of the survivors have mutated, became aggressive and formed gangs to patrol the wasteland on their hand-made vehicles.


###Gameplay
The player has to fight enemy characters (in PvE modes) and other players (in PvP battles) using armored cars. Victories increase the player's reputation and allow him or her to join various factions and craft their deadly weapons. There are missions the player can complete to earn more fame, money, and spare parts to customize his or her car. The game features advanced damage model, which means that any part of a vehicle can be shot off during a battle. For example a player can lose all wheels and get his car immobilized.


###Customization
The game offers a variety of options for customization. Every player can assemble his or her unique car from scratch from dozens of spare parts. The cabin and the frame are the only two obligatory parts, the rest is up to the player. He or she can enhance the vehicle with weapons, armor, accelerators and other devices to fit his or her driving style. However, the design has to be practical and balanced at least to some extent. Awkwardly built vehicles can lose control or flip over.

Starting with nothing, but simple clothes, flair, and a rug, players will have to scavenge for items, transport, and weapons, while running away from either zeds, bandits or hostile players.
DayZ can be played as a single player game, but most of the current player base is using multiplayer servers in order to form groups, clans and survive together.  In order to make the survival aspect more realistic, aside from thirst and hunger, several diseases have been added to the game, with specific cures for each effect.

The only stat a worm has is its health. On the contrary, there is a huge variety of weapons and constructions that can be used during the fight.

The fighting system presents wielding two weapons at a time with the latter being divided into two main categories: melee — primary weapons and throwable — secondary ones. 

###Gameplay

Gameplay in Kane & Lynch is slightly reminiscent of GTA series with its third-person cop-shooting massacres. However, instead of the open world, there are consecutive levels with a mission in each, like in Hitman series (which was made by the same studio). 
In the story mode, Kane is the only protagonist under the player’s control. Lynch and other members of the gang are AI-controlled, though Kane can order them to move, follow, or attack. In the co-op mode, the other player can assume the role of Lynch. Playing for him is a little different because Lynch is a psychopath who sees hallucinations.

POSTAL,"POSTAL is the first part in its series of shooting games. It is best known and somewhat infamous for its uncanny violence, cynical black humor, and a highly controversial theme. The game offers the player to ""go postal"" on a spree shooting across the city.

###Plot
The player controls the protagonist, nicknamed The Postal Dude: a homeless middle-aged man who apparently goes crazy and hears disembodied voices. He believes in a conspiracy theory that US government has poisoned his hometown with a nerve agent, and he's the only sane person around. He tries to eliminate the crowd he considers ""infected"". His goal is to fight his way to the US Air Force base which he believes is responsible for the presumed attack.

###Gameplay
Unlike its better-known sequel, POSTAL is 2D and uses top-down and isometric views. On each level, the player has to kill a specified share of enemies: civilians, military, and police alike. When this goal is complete, the door to the next level will appear. The player can complete the level even if The Postal Dude is killed, as long as the number of his own kills is satisfactory. The character can carry up to 8 types of weapons with varying strength and ammo limit. His basic gun is the weakest but has indefinite ammo supply.

Full Throttle Remastered,"One minute you’re on the road, riding, not a care in the world. Then some guy in a suit comes along and says he’s got a deal for you and your gang. But when you come to, you’ve got a lump on your head, the law on your back, and a feeling in your gut that the road you’re on is about to get a lot rougher…
Originally released by LucasArts in 1995, Full Throttle is a classic graphic adventure game from industry legend Tim Schafer, telling the story of Ben Throttle; butt-kicking leader of biker gang the Polecats, who gets caught up in a tale of Motorcycles, Mayhem and Murder.
Now over 20 years later, Full Throttle is back in a remastered edition that features all new hand-drawn and 3D high-resolution artwork with 4k support, and with remastered audio and music. Blow your speakers with movie-quality sound and a full digital score featuring the GONE JACKALS - an authentic hard-hammerin' biker band!
Players will be able to switch back and forth between classic and remastered modes, and mix-n-match audio and graphics options to their heart’s desire. Also included is a concept art browser with work from Peter Chan, and a commentary track with the game’s original creators.
Full Throttle was the first game with Tim Schafer as sole project lead, and a much beloved cult classic! This special edition has been lovingly restored and remade with the care and attention that can only come from involving the game's original creators. It’s headed to PS4, PS Vita and PC in 2017.",77.0,3,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Cloud', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Great Soundtrack', '2D', 'Classic', 'Point & Click', 'overlay', 'Remake', 'Cult Classic', 'cloud saves']","['PlayStation Store', 'Xbox Store', 'Steam', 'GOG', 'itch.io', 'App Store']",Teen,"['Double Fine Productions', 'Shiny Shoe']",['Double Fine Productions'],2025-05-13T08:30:21,"{'yet': 301, 'owned': 2265, 'beaten': 279, 'toplay': 93, 'dropped': 54, 'playing': 20}"
Thief 3: Deadly Shadows,"Thief 3: Deadly Shadows is a stealth-action game developed by Ion Storm Inc. It is the third installment in the Thief franchise.

The game is set in a Steampunk world that resembles both the middle ages and the Victorian era. Besides that, there are several fantasy elements in the game. The thief named Garett is a member of the thief guild. He receives a letter in which the guild invites him to listen out the new prophecy. In order to be let in the palace where the prophecy will be unraveled, Garett has to steal two sacred relics. His new adventure begins.

The game can be played both from first-person and third-person perspective. The player may steal from innocents and avoid, distract, knock out or kill guards. Loot and weapons are picked up just by standing close enough to them. Locked areas can be unlocked using a lock-picking minigame. The player has to stick to the shadows during the missions, as running or walking will alert the guards who will come looking for Garett. 

The levels are fairly open-ended and have different paths for the player to choose from. After completing each mission, the player is free to explore the City for loot. City areas unlock as the game goes on.",85.0,1,"['Singleplayer', 'Atmospheric', 'Story Rich', 'Open World', 'First-Person', 'Third Person', 'Horror', 'Fantasy', 'Classic', 'Stealth', 'Dark', 'Dark Fantasy', 'Medieval', 'Steampunk', 'Immersive Sim']","['GOG', 'Steam']",Mature,['Ion Storm'],['Square Enix'],2024-10-09T14:04:11,"{'yet': 221, 'owned': 2510, 'beaten': 115, 'toplay': 60, 'dropped': 98, 'playing': 4}"
Return Of The Obra Dinn,"In 1802, the merchant ship ""Obra Dinn"" set out from London for the Orient with over 200 tons of trade goods. Six months later it hadn't met its rendezvous point at the Cape of Good Hope and was declared lost at sea.  
 
Early this morning of October 14th, 1807, the Obra Dinn drifted into port with sails damaged and no visible crew. As insurance adjustor for the East India Company's London Office, find means to board the ship and recover the Crew Muster Roll book for assessment.

(""Obra"" is pronounced like ""Cobra"" without the C).

From the author:

Goals

I want to challenge myself so this'll be a very different game from anything I've done before, including Papers Please. There'll be less creativity with the gameplay and instead I want to experiment with the rendering, story, and a few technical features. Right now I have only a rough idea about the narrative. I'm hoping to capture a compelling mystery with suspense and twists in the limited space of an old merchant sailing ship. It won't be the typical ""collect items and look for clues"" structure. There's a slightly cool gameplay hook but I won't go into details on that until much later.


Devlog

I'll try to keep this (https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.0) devlog lively as I make progress. Because the gameplay itself is more standard, there probably won't be as many creative updates as the Papers Please devlog. I will post lots of pictures and builds as soon as I'm able. Things will likely also move slower than Papers Please did too, at least at the start. P,P still takes a good amount of my time so there's less chance for me to maintain a laser-like focus on one project like last time. The lower bound for finishing this game is around 3 months but realistically I think it'll take me around half a year. My Maya skills are pretty rusty so I expect the modeling/animation to take the most time.


1-bit Rendering

My first computer was a Mac Plus. I've always had a nostalgia-softened spot in my heart for 1-bit graphics. I'd like to capture the detailed black & white look of old Mac games in a realtime 1st person game. I plan to push it grittier and less cartoon-like than those old games; the hard part will be keeping everything legible without it becoming an unreadable mess of dithered pixels. One interesting problem with 1-bit rendering is that it doesn't scale well for images and it compresses to video like shit - so YouTube stuff may look really poor. We'll see how it goes.


Unity 3D

I'm gonna use Unity for this one. I fell in love with Haxe/OpenFL on my last project but unfortunately the 3D situation is not that great there yet. Also, it's time to finally see why 90% of the indie scene is using Unity. I have a good amount of experience with 3D games and the few days I've played around with Unity so far have been pretty productive. The animated title screen scene up there (with post-processing shaders and all) was created in one day. I now have unrealistically high hopes.",88.0,5,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'Horror', 'Gore', 'Violent', 'Mystery', 'Detective', 'Pirates', 'Time Manipulation', 'ship', '1-bit', 'mac-plus', 'dinn', 'obra']","['Nintendo Store', 'PlayStation Store', 'Xbox Store', 'GOG', 'Steam', 'itch.io']",Mature,"['3909', 'Lucas Pope', 'dukope']",['3909'],2025-04-07T15:21:12,"{'yet': 208, 'owned': 1451, 'beaten': 572, 'toplay': 580, 'dropped': 140, 'playing': 52}"
Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes,"Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a game about defusing a bomb. It was initially made for virtual reality headsets but also supports traditional screens and controls.

###Player cooperation
The game is meant to be played by at least two people in cooperation. Only one of them is wearing the VR headset or actually interacts with the computer. He or she acts as the main defuser who has to deactivate the bomb. All other players assume the roles of the experts. Their task is to help the defuser by reading aloud a manual about bombs. The experts need to be either in the same room with the defuser or to contact him or her over an audio messenger. 

The defuser is the only player who can see the bomb. He or she has to describe it in details to other players. The experts, in turn, have to find the described blocks in their manuals and tell the defuser what to do to solve the puzzle. 

###Bombs as puzzles
The composition and other attributes of each bomb are randomly generated for each level, and the players can customize them. The bombs consist of individual blocks, which are puzzles on their own. Some of the blocks require regular attention from the defuser, while others can be disarmed once and for all. 

The time for each level is limited. When the countdown reaches the end, the bomb will explode. Defuser's errors may also speed up the countdown or even activate the bomb and ""kill"" him or her. Each bomb has its own limit of time and errors.",67.0,3,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'Full controller support', 'Atmospheric', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Co-op', 'cooperative', 'First-Person', 'Funny', 'Difficult', 'Local Co-Op', 'Local Multiplayer', 'stats', 'Steam Workshop', 'Family Friendly', 'Team-Based', 'Fast-Paced', 'VR', 'party', 'Board Game', 'communication', 'Asymmetric VR']","['PlayStation Store', 'Steam', 'Xbox Store', 'Nintendo Store', 'Google Play']",Everyone 10+,['Steel Crate Games'],['Steel Crate Games'],2025-03-23T17:18:00,"{'yet': 97, 'owned': 2340, 'beaten': 208, 'toplay': 60, 'dropped': 253, 'playing': 44}"
Divine Divinity,"The first game in the Divinity franchise introduces the player to the medieval high fantasy world of Rivellon aka Land of Divinity. There’s an extensive backstory of the setting in the game. Rivellon is a troubled place torn by wars and rebellions and threatened by the awakening forces of Chaos. The protagonist starts his journey in the city of Aleroth. His or her first mission is to save the city’s chief healer who was cursed into madness by an evil wizard. After that, the protagonist is free to explore the world and accept a variety of side quests from NPCs.

The main character is fully customizable. At the start, the player is allowed to choose between six characters, who are male and female versions of the same three classes (Warrior, Mage, and Survivor). Each class has its own set of skills and attributes. However, over the course of the game, the character can learn virtually any skill regardless of his or her class. The game is played from an isometric view using point-and-click controls, thus being quite similar to the Diablo series. Unlike Diablo, it has a stronger leaning towards the classic RPG genre. Divine Divinity includes complex dialogue options, skill trees, and a reputation system.

The gameplay is similar to the X-COM games: all missions are turn-based. Each agent under player’s control has a limited action point that he can use during the turn. Often the main task on the map is to possess a certain object. During the missions, the player can complete additional quests that allow you to open new agents and equipment.",82.0,3,"['Singleplayer', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Sci-fi', 'Difficult', 'Female Protagonist', 'Stealth', 'Tactical', 'Turn-Based', 'Roguelike', 'Isometric', 'Turn-Based Strategy', 'Cyberpunk', 'Roguelite', 'Procedural Generation', 'Turn-Based Tactics', 'Perma Death']","['Steam', 'GOG', 'App Store']",,['Klei Entertainment'],['Klei Entertainment'],2025-01-14T01:02:40,"{'yet': 217, 'owned': 2361, 'beaten': 106, 'toplay': 82, 'dropped': 161, 'playing': 25}"

Sid Meier's Civilization IV,"As with the rest of Sid Meier’s Civilization series, the player controls a real historical civilization and leads it from the stone age to the space era.

There are eighteen playable civilizations in the game with some of them having multiple leaders to choose from. Each PC-controlled leader is based on an actual historical figure and has his or her unique personality traits, such as being diplomatic or aggressive.

Civilization IV was the first to introduce different religions rather than an abstract ""religion"" as a concept. There are seven available religions that can be founded during the game and spread across the map, increasing their founder's influence and boosting his citizens' happiness. The fourth part also introduced the idea of Great People, such as scientists, artists, and prophets, who are also based on actual persons.

The dungeons are filled with intricate traps to evade, puzzles to solve, and hungry monsters to fight in real-time mode. 
Legend of Grimrock has a strong old-school dungeon crawler feel to it, and its creators proudly admit that they were inspired by the traditional first-person RPGs like Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder. The player assumes control over a party of four customizable characters that are divided into three traditional D&D classes (fighter, rogue, and mage) and four quite non-traditional races (besides Human, there are Minotaur, Lizardman, and Insectoid). 

There's a bit of Portal to Legend of Grimrock, in that the prisoners are instructed by a disembodied and unreliable voice that promises them a cheerful party if they make it through the dungeon.

Fable: The Lost Chapters,"Fable: The Lost Chapters is a re-release for the personal computers of the Fable game, originally created for the Xbox. This release includes content that is not included in the release of the game for Xbox.
The main character is personalized in great detail. Everything that he does affects him. He can get obesity from a plentiful meal, and if he drinks alcohol, he will become poorly oriented and eventually will vomit.

Clothing, hairstyles, beards and tattoos of the hero influence how others perceive the hero. For example, light clothing causes benevolence, and dark - fear.

Of course, the attitude towards the hero is influenced by his actions. The proportion of good and evil acts affects his appearance. If he does many good deeds, he has a halo above his head and other signs of holiness. If he is more inclined to evil deeds, he grows horns, smoke comes from under his feet, and his eyes get a red glow.
The hero grows old regardless of whether he is good or evil. In his old age, his hair grows gray. If he spends his experience on new skills, he becomes noticeably older. Among the things that you can buy in the city, there is real estate. You can buy a house, rent out and get paid. If you decorate the house with trophies, the rental rate will be greater.

In addition to the war with the enemies, you can search for treasure and fish or participate in sports fistfights. And even better - try to find the Doors of Demons, who can talk. Doors give tasks, after performing which the hero will pass into hidden locations and acquire rare things.

RimWorld,"RimWorld is a sci-fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller. Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Firefly, and Dune.
You begin with three survivors of a shipwreck on a distant world.
Manage colonists' moods, needs, wounds, and illnesses.
Fashion structures, weapons, and apparel from metal, wood, stone, cloth, or futuristic materials.
Tame and train cute pets, productive farm animals, and deadly attack beasts.
Watch colonists develop and break relationships with family members, lovers, and spouses.
Fight pirate raiders, hostile tribes, rampaging animals, giant tunnelling insects and ancient killing machines.
Trade with passing ships and trade caravans.
Decorate your colony to make it into a pleasurable space.
Dig through snow, weather storms, and fight fires.
Capture refugees or prisoners and turn them to your side or sell them into slavery.
Discover a new generated world each time you play.
Build colonies in the desert, jungle, tundra, and more.
Learn to play easily with the help of an intelligent and unobtrusive AI tutor.
RimWorld is a story generator. It’s designed to co-author tragic, twisted, and triumphant stories about imprisoned pirates, desperate colonists, starvation and survival. It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.
Your colonists are not professional settlers – they’re crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.
Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.
Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.
The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert plain, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.
You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.
People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.
Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.
You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.
And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active mod community. Read more at http://rimworldgame.com.

Rage 2,"RAGE 2 is the second installment in the RAGE series of post-apocalyptic action games. It is inspired by the Mad Max movie series.

###Plot and setting
The game is set in 2165, thirty years after the events of the original Rage. More than a century before that, the Apophis asteroid fell on Earth, causing mass destruction and driving humanity to near-extinction. The few remaining people hide in the few safe oases, while the rest of the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland raided by gangsters and evil mutants. The main protagonist is a man named Walker, who is the last ranger of the wasteland and a wielder of superhuman powers. He fights against the totalitarian organization called The Authority.

###Gameplay
Like in the original RAGE, the sequel emphasizes its over-the-top action. The player controls Walker from the first person view and uses his huge guns and other weapons to fight monsters. The protagonist can also drive any vehicle that can be found in the game and engage in vehicular battles. When the player is driving, the game switches to the third person view. A new feature introduced in RAGE 2 is its Overdrive system that encourages aggressive playing style.

DISTRAINT,"DISTRAINT is a two-dimensional adventure horror indie game developed by Jessee Makkonen.

###Setting
You play as a man named Price. Price is a repo man who is tasked with repossessing a house of an old woman in order to save his partnership with a big corporation. Rather than scaring the player using jumpscares, the game uses it's own atmosphere and explores the everyday horrors people encounter. The game explores the themes of greed, regret, and quilt. 

###Gameplay
Being developed in only 77 days, the game is described as a speed project by its creator. It will take you 2 hours to complete the game's story. DISTRAINT is a pixel art-inspired narrative-driven experience. The players can only move left and right and use their flashlight. Button prompts for different actions appear on-screen. All the graphics in the game is hand drawn and also animated by hand. No asset in the game is used twice, as stated by the game's developer. “No cheap tricks!” as he puts it.

No HUD is present in the game. This was made to distract the player from the game as less as possible.

You decide the combat role you want to assume in the world of Brink as you fight to save yourself and mankind’s last refuge. Brink offers a compelling mix of dynamic battlefields, extensive customization options, and an innovative control system that will keep you coming back for more.
Brink takes place on the Ark, a man-made floating city that is on the brink of all-out civil war. Originally built as an experimental, self-sufficient and 100% “green” habitat, the reported rapid rise of the Earth’s oceans has forced the Ark to become home to not only the original founders and their descendants but also to thousands of refugees. With tensions between the two groups growing, Security and Resistance forces are locked in a heated battle for control of the Ark. Which side will you choose?

KEY FEATURES:											Not Just Another Hero – Brink's advanced player customization offers a near-endless combination of looks for your character – allowing for the appearance of your character to be truly unique.  As you progress through the game and acquire more experience, you’ll have even more opportunities for customization.
Two Sides to Every Story – Choose to fight through the single player campaign as either a member of the Resistance or the Security and then take your same character online to play cooperatively or competitively against other players.
Blurring the Lines – Take your unique character online at any time you choose!  Brink allows you to seamlessly move between your single player campaign, co-op with friends, and intense multiplayer action. Multiplayer takes the story online where you can play with up to seven other people (or AI characters) cooperatively as you take on the opposing faction or with up to 16 players competitively.
Play SMART – Brink uses the familiar shooter controls that you’re used to, without frustrating, artificial constraints and adds a new feature: the SMART button.  When you press the SMART button, the game dynamically evaluates where you’re trying to get to, and makes it happen. Whether you’re a seasoned FPS veteran or someone just getting started, you’ll be able to make more intelligent decisions during the fast-paced action with SMART.
Context-Sensitive Goals and Rewards - Objectives, communications, missions, and inventory selection are all dynamically generated based on your role, your condition, your location, your squad-mates, and the overall status of the battle in all gameplay modes.

However it's not just the fallen heroes that have been dragged into the abyss: the Overlord's newly loyal peasants have also been taken down into hell too.
With the undead denizens of each abyss on the attack and threatening the Overlord's reign above ground, there's only one thing for it: assemble your minion army, descend into each abyss and embark on a fresh wave of tyranny in order to return the serfs to their homelands, defeat the fallen heroes once and for all, and claim the throne of each kingdom's underworld.

Dark Souls II,"Dark Souls II is the third installment in the well-known Souls series. It’s a different game from all the others because of its directors. With Dark Souls II the main director and founder of Souls-like genre Hidetaka Miyazaki took place only as a supervisor of the project, leaving a place of the director of the game for two young video game designers Tomohiro Shibuya and Yui Tanimura. One could ask if the game is as good and beautiful as other past games in the Series and the answer would be that Dark Souls II is different yet deep and unforgiving as all the other titles in the series. The famous difficulty of previous games is still there but the world is much simpler yet connected and dangerous. Enemies still respond after death of a player but only about 15 times. After that they disappear forever. Boss battles are much simpler, this time focuses on many simpler bosses at a time instead of one powerful boss. 
Dark Souls II is one of those games which were painfully downgraded in a favor of hardware of consoles, that means that players got less graphically advanced version than promised.

Pyre,"Pyre is an action-adventure game developed by Supergiant games. 

###Setting
The game is set in some purgatory. After getting banished by the society, the main character finds himself all alone. Three exiles soon approach him and invite the protagonist to party with them and nickname him the Reader. The group sets out to cleanse their souls.

###Gameplay
The gameplay of Pyre revolves around some sports game, which is connected with a ritual known as the Rites, which happens in a parallel world. The Protagonist controls his three newly found friends in battles against three opponents on a small arena. Each team has its own pyre. Both pyres oppose each other. The objective of the game is to defend your pyre while attacking the enemy one. The player can only destroy the pyre with the orb, that is spawned in the center of the arena and which has to be grabbed and thrown into the pyre.

During a round, the Reader can switch between the character he wants to control and pass the orb from one to another. Each player has their own amount of endurance which is required for moving around the arena. If the players of a team come together, they create a zone that is dangerous for the player that carries the orb. If the player with the orb should get into that zone, they'll be temporarily removed from the game.

While free from the Rites, the player can travel through the world of Pyre, train his teammates or try to learn more about the Rites.",84.0,4,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Cloud', 'Atmospheric', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Great Soundtrack', 'RPG', 'Story Rich', '2D', 'Fantasy', 'Local Multiplayer', 'Captions available', 'Choices Matter', 'Multiple Endings', 'Visual Novel', 'Hand-drawn', 'Party-Based RPG']","['itch.io', 'PlayStation Store', 'Steam', 'GOG']",Everyone 10+,['Supergiant Games'],['Supergiant Games'],2025-05-21T17:51:50,"{'yet': 268, 'owned': 1941, 'beaten': 315, 'toplay': 204, 'dropped': 154, 'playing': 36}"

Space Engineers,"Space Engineers is a game about exploring planets, building spaceships and stations, and mining resources from asteroids. It was a precursor of sorts to No Man’s Sky. The player explores worlds and systems that are based on the settings and options selected by the player; for example, the use of procedural generation, the speed of processes, and the hostility of the environment. Space Engineers allows a lot of options for customization, and the game’s code is open source, making it popular among modders.
The player assumes control over the human protagonist in a space suit and, at some stages of the game, an exploration ship (with options for both first and third person view). The player can build a variety of structures using different types of blocks and tools. Available structures include ships, planetary outposts, and space stations. 
The game includes a campaign and a set of standalone scenarios. Each of the scenarios, in turn, can be played in “Creative” or “Survival” mode. The former is an easy sandbox in which the player is not limited in resources and cannot die. The latter requires the player to mine resources and to keep track of the main character’s health and oxygen level.

The game is set in a medieval world called Terratus that was almost completely conquered by Kyros, an immortal evil overlord. No one has ever seen Kyros, but he spent four centuries uniting all the realms under his reign. Kyros rules through his powerful viceroys, the Archons, who, in turn, command their minions called Fatebinders. The protagonist is one of Fatebinders at Kyros' service. He or she is sent to the Tiers province that is torn by the conflict. Two of the Kyros' armies fight each other, and it slows down the conquest. The protagonist has to stop the conflict or to be executed.

###Gameplay
The player has to create the main character from scratch and define his or her abilities. The game has no character classes, and the character skills are individual. The process of customization also includes several questions about the character's background. The answers define how the character is perceived by the others and which factions he or she may join. The factions also influence the main character's abilities and the companions the player can recruit.

As the user plays he discovers new tactics and movements, like rocket jumping and strafe. In total there are 12 modes in the game.

Tricky Towers,"Tricky Towers is a tower-building puzzle game developed by WeirdBeard.

In Tricky Towers, the players have to stack the falling blocks of a building into one tower. The game bears some resemblance to Tetris with the difference being the objective to stack the blocks instead of clearing rows of them. The rows do not disappear. The game is physics-based, so the player can't win by just dropping the blocks in a random manner. Several in-game events are present, for example, the blocks may drop faster or become slippery. Sometimes the blocks even double in size. You play as a wizard that competes against other wizards and has to build his tower as tall and stable as possible. 

It is possible to cast spells that either assist the players or make the building harder for other wizzards. The players can use 17 spells Throughout a match. Light magic spells are used for making the gameplay easier for the player while Dark magic spells make it harder for your opponents to progress. 

Three game modes are present: Race, Puzzle, and Survival. A handful of single-player challenges is also available where the player has to meet certain game conditions to succeed.",80.0,3,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'Full controller support', 'steam-trading-cards', 'cooperative', '2D', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Online multiplayer', 'Split Screen', 'Local Multiplayer', 'Physics', '4 Player Local', 'party']","['PlayStation Store', 'Steam', 'Xbox Store', 'Nintendo Store', 'App Store']",Everyone 10+,"['WeirdBeard', 'Marcus Dobler Applications UG']","['WeirdBeard', 'Marcus Dobler Applications UG']",2025-04-12T13:12:36,"{'yet': 76, 'owned': 2278, 'beaten': 158, 'toplay': 38, 'dropped': 256, 'playing': 39}"

Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist,"Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell Blacklist is a stealth-action game developed by Ubisoft Toronto. It is the sixth main installment in the series.

###Story
The game takes place six months after the events of Conviction. The Third Echelon got disbanded, and Sam Fischer became a private security contractor. A terrorist organization known as The Engineers threatens the United States with a series of terrorist attacks if the U.S. Military will not call off their troops stationed in other countries. POTUS comes to Fischer, forms the Fourth Echelon and grants Sam with a Fifth Freedom - the freedom to defend the four first freedoms no matter what it takes.

###Gameplay
Splinter Cell Blacklist focuses on a stealth mission approach. The player is still free to go in loud, but it will be much harder, as Fischer can sustain a very small amount of damage even on the lowest difficulty.

The players have a wide range of gadgets at their disposal, such as the snake cam, a throwable sticky camera that can distract enemies, a portable EMP, and a variety of grenades. It is also possible to upgrade Fisher's outfit, making it more stealthy or improve its armor. The players can also upgrade their HQ to gain certain advantages on the battlefield, such as an improved minimap.

The game evaluates the players' performance. Three play styles are available - Ghost, a complete stealth approach with no kills; Panther - a stealthy approach with enemy kills; Assault - a head-on gunfight with the enemies.",81.0,10,['cooperative'],"['Xbox Store', 'Steam']",Mature,['Ubisoft Toronto'],['Ubisoft Entertainment'],2025-05-23T05:42:46,"{'yet': 166, 'owned': 1831, 'beaten': 608, 'toplay': 86, 'dropped': 130, 'playing': 11}"
Mini Ninjas,"Mini Ninjas is set in a cartoonish version of medieval Japan and puts you into the role of a cute ninja. Your village was attacked by an Evil Samurai Warlord, who uses magic to turn the innocent animals into his loyal soldiers. There’s no killing and no blood; defeating your enemies will only make them disappear and return to their natural shape. 
There are six playable characters, although Hiro is the default protagonist. Each of the ninjas has different skills and weapons. Some of the characters can use stealth to avoid the battle or to perform a wall-jump. There are also spells that allow you to fire lightning bolts at your opponents or to turn you into an animal for camouflage and sneaking. 
The game is full of visual staples about East Asia, such as traditional Japanese lanterns and hats, architecture, bamboo groves, pandas, masked ninjas, and armored samurai. The “chibi” (baby-like) design of the characters, along with their comically high-pitched voices, make all these look like a light-hearted parody rather than actual stereotypes.

King's Bounty: The Legend,"This spiritual successor to the 1990 King's Bounty revived the franchise and spawned a series of sequels.

The protagonist is a rookie hero who offers his services to Mark, the king of Darion, and is to become his Royal Treasure Searcher. The player’s goal is to complete quests that will earn his or her character the titular king’s bounty, be it gold or a rank in nobility. 
Unlike the original TBS game, The Legend combines tactical gameplay with role-playing elements, such as character classes, experience, and a tree of skills. Your class (warrior, paladin, or magician) is assigned automatically based on your actions in the tutorial mission. There are also dialogues, character interaction, and even romance options than allow your character to marry and have children. The player explores the world’s map in real time, like in most RPGs. The combat system, however, is completely different. During battles, the player controls not the hero, but the hero's units, the number of which depends on the character’s “Leadership”.

Poker Night at the Inventory,"Four famous characters - Max (Sam & Max game series), RED Heavy (Team Fortress 2 game), Tycho (Penny Arcade webcomic), and Strong Bad (Homestar Runner web series) - just sit around a table in the underground casino called Inventory and play poker. According to its owner, it is hidden under a video game store and is kept secret so that if the government outlaws gambling one day, it will know nothing of Inventory. The player does not control any of the characters but is instead an invisible character on its own, who is literally referred to as The Player by other characters. 
All players have a reserve of $10,000 at the beginning and leave the game if they're left nothing to put at stake. The ultimate goal for the player is to remain the last one sitting behind the table.

###Gameplay
The players control their characters from the first person view and fight each other in teams or individually using various firearms.

Hue,"In a one-color world, one scholar, working in one of the universities, suddenly discovers the phenomenon of color. But where she works, nobody needs her discovery. And even worse - the scientist is expelled from the university. At the same time, the color discovered by this scientist is spreading in her one-color world. In punishment, the scientist is sent to another world - the world of impossible flowers. Impossible colors are those colors that are invisible to the human eye, they are outside the visible spectrum.

The player plays for a little boy named Hue, who one morning wakes up and starts looking for eight visible сolors to save the scientist from the world of invisible colors.

###Game mechanics based on color
In the game, objects can be seen, but with them you can do something only if the color of these objects is different from the color of the game's background. For example, you start with a black background, and you can see a black door on a black background - you can see its outline. But you can open it only if you change its color to some other one. or if you change the background color. And you can change the background color only when you find, ""open"" some color. For example, the first color to open in the game is Aqua. After you open this color, you can make this color the background color of the game. And then the door will be black and you will be able to open it. This technique is used in many games - but usually it is implemented only for one color, for example, white on black or vice versa. In Hue, the player deals with eight colors - after the opening of each next color, the game is correspondingly more complicated.

There are many objects in the game that you need to interact with in order to go further. And each object has to be made real by using the color mechanics described above. And also find a way to properly interact with the object itself. There are many puzzles in the game, and often they seem to be unresolved, but after the decision is finally found, the player is usually surprised how he could not see this decision from the very beginning.

###The Mysteries of the Final
In addition to the fascinating mechanics, the game also has a story - a story about a woman researcher who discovered color for a one-color world. This story develops throughout the game, its fragments open gradually and in the end everything will turn into one picture.",79.0,2,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Cloud', 'Great Soundtrack', '2D', 'Colorful', 'Metroidvania', 'Puzzle-Platformer', 'Narration']","['Nintendo Store', 'PlayStation Store', 'Xbox Store', 'Steam', 'App Store', 'Epic Games']",Everyone,"['Curve Digital', 'Serkan Binici', 'Fiddlesticks Games', 'Fiddlesticks']","['Curve Digital', 'Serkan Binici']",2025-04-14T21:24:39,"{'yet': 219, 'owned': 2216, 'beaten': 185, 'toplay': 28, 'dropped': 131, 'playing': 22}"

Your kingdom is a reflection of your character and your choices throughout the game. It is a living thing shaped by your alignment, your allies, and your ability to lead your people. Not only can your kingdom expand, opening up new territories and allowing you to build new towns and communities, but your capital city will physically change based on your decisions, your policies, and even whom you choose to ally with.

Quake II,"Quake II is a first-person shooter developed by id Software. It is a direct sequel to the first Quake game.

###Plot
In the distant future, an alien race of Stroggs attack human colonies. As a result, humanity develops operation Overlord as a countermeasure and launches a counter-attack at the Strogg homeworld called Stroggos. The main objective of the soldiers is to close down the portal, which is used by Stroggs to teleport their armies on Earth. The operation does not go as smooth as planned and Bitterman, the main protagonist, is the sole survivor of his squad. He must finish the mission.

###Gameplay
Quake II is an iconic first-person shooter. There are no health regeneration or weapon reloading systems present in the game. Instead, the players have to pick up health kits, ammo packs, and scavenge ammo from the dead Stroggs. 

As the game progresses, more strong Stroggs appear, their numbers rise, and these aliens become much more accurate. More types of Stroggs also appear, such as the medics, that can revive their fallen comrades.

The game features 36 levels with the addition of three secret ones. Secrets are hidden on all levels, which contain useful items within them, such as a Quad Damage special boost.

Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving...
Just make sure you don't forget to breathe.

Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive:
Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live.
I
t’s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations:
Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost.

Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics:
Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists.

Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations:
Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine.

Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations:
Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly.

Always Keep Yourself Breathing:
Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis.

Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling:
Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food.

Dear Esther,"Dear Esther is a game that questions the very concept of a ""game"" as an entertainment. It is more of an art project that was originally started as a mod on the Source engine (the one Half-Life 2 is based on). The player assumes the role of a nameless and faceless character, a man, who wanders around a cold island at the shores of Scotland. When you enter certain parts of the island, the main character reads aloud his letters from the past, revealing his tragic story. All other characters, including the protagonists’ wife Esther, are only mentioned by the narrator and do not appear in the game. There's very little actual gameplay, and your goal as a player is to explore the island and discover as many parts of the backstory as possible.

The game is allowing you to run and jump almost anywhere and do whatever the player wants - anarchy!

He was eventually killed and reborn, and now needs to travel the entire kingdom to gain power and set the world free.

Your character is fully customizable and can be upgraded with souls you get through battles.

Pathologic Classic HD,"The original Indie Cult Classic returns fully restored, and more evocative than ever.
Pathologic Classic HD is the Definitive Edition of the original Cult Classic Psychological First-Person Survival game. The game represents a unique and unforgettable experience as it transports players in a weird town which crouches, ominous, in the far reaches of an ancient steppe. It was once a small drover settlement, huddled around a monstrous abattoir—but something about the butchery it was near has changed it. It has developed an odd social structure over the course of several generations. It could have quietly continued along its weird way, but a sudden outbreak of an unknown and inevitably lethal disease has decimated the citizens. Prayers did not help. Science did not help. So, finally, they have turned to outsiders for help: three of them enter the town in hope of finding a cure or—failing that—an explanation. The first outsider was a ruthless investigator, assigned by local authorities. The second is a far-sighted Ripper who has used his extraordinary abilities to gain a reputation as an ingenious surgeon, who has come to the town in search of his father's terrible heritage. The third—and last—outsider is an eccentric girl rumored to have mystic healing abilities; she may become the town's salvation were it not for the constant fear that plagues her, the memory of the horrors of her recent past.
On the surface, Pathologic is a first person horror adventure game where you control one of three ""heroes."" Dig deeper, however, and you’ll find an experience that will affect your emotional and psychological state. In the world of Pathologic you’ll find yourself in situations where morals and good deeds are meaningless in the face of raw despair and endless need. Talk to the denizens of the town and decide for yourself if you wish to ease someone else’s pain or save every bit of precious medicine to protect yourself from the invisible and inexorable plague. Become witness to the miasma of horror as the plague begins to overcome the town.

12 days in a plague-ridden town. Time is running, and mostly it’s running out; numerous events unfold, whether you’re there to witness them or not.
70+ hours of real-time gameplay without grinding or repetitive quests. As time goes by, more and more things happen, inviting you to participate and change the course of events.
3 playable characters with 3 unique storylines. The Bachelor’s, the Haruspex’s, and the Changeling’s plots are interconnected, but every side of the trilemma is represented separately via unique events, quests, dialogues, and subplots.
The plot is critically acclaimed and often regarded as the high point of the game. It’s not just about the fate of the dying town—it’s about an ideological conflict, represented by a multitude of characters and factions, each with their own idea of what life, death, and miracles are.
An open-world game. While the plot is there to grab you, the town has no artificial boundaries: you are free to explore it from day one, carving out your own story.
Survival is tough. The dying town demands that you constantly keep an eye on your status, maintaining a full belly and decent immunity. That will require tough choices.
Communicate, barter, rob, or steal. There are many ways to acquire your bare necessities, each of them with its own benefits and drawbacks.

The game heavily relies on the ancient Greek mythology and uses it as inspiration and the main source for enemies and NPC design as well as locations design. However, the game is not a great source of accurate historical facts: Ancient Greece history was rewritten for the sake of the genre and the game universe, the rules of which were established in the first part.

###The story
King of the gods Zeus betrays Kratos and kills him, but the Spartan is saved from the Underworld by another goddess Gaia, who invites Kratos to find the Sisters of Fate and go to the past and prevent his own murder. The gameplay remained the same: the player can use several attacks, which can be combined and improved with the help of the in-game currency collected from enemies.

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world, in which a nuclear war annihilated all humanity. Many years later, Earth is inhabited by the mutated creatures that look like combinations of humans with other animals and things. There's The Ark, a neon-lit sinkhole that serves as the hub for the player characters. This is where they can buy ammunition and armor, meet other characters and accept quests. Then there's the Zone, a largely unexplored dangerous world where Mutants roam. Somewhere in the Zone lies the legendary Eden, a safe haven where they can find all the answers they seek.

###Characters
The game has three main protagonists. First, there's Dux, the duck-headed wise-cracking mutant with an attitude. Then there's Bormin, a huge gruff pig that has anger issues. Their third companion is Selma, a seemingly human female who has protective stone skin. Each of the characters specializes in using certain weapons and has a set of special mutant abilities.

SCP: Secret Laboratory,"SCP: Secret Laboratory is a multiplayer horror game, based on SCP - Containment Breach by Regalis (2012). To create this game, Unity engine was used to provide high stability and good graphics. Still being at the beta phase, game can contain an amount of bugs and errors which are usually spotted by a large team of testers and fixed quickly after.

It is a completely free horror game based on SCP Foundation creepypasta series. The Foundation focuses on protecting world from any entity, object or phenomenon which exceeds the all-known idea of normal.

The underground facility suffers from multiple breaches from various SCP objects which escape their containment chambers. During this events chain, players are given roles to play:
Class-D Personnel - Prisoners kept for a purpose of being lab rats. Their mission is to escape the facility without getting any attention from others.
Nine-Tailed Fox - Team designated to neutralize the danger and rescue Scientists.
Scientist - Breach attendant that tries to escape the facility alive.
SCP Object - anomaly trying to kill as much people as possibly. Currently only few SCP objects can be found in-game, but progressively their number will grow in oncoming updates.
Chaos Insurgency - Foundation traitors, trying to help Class D to escape in order to obtain helpful information.

Randomly generated facility and role division makes every game special and full of sensations! You never know where you are heading or what awaits you behind the next door, no matter of what role you are playing. The winner team is one that finished all of its objectives.

There are many ways of fighting against enemies, from using firearms to detonating the whole facility with an hydrogen bomb.

In the game, we can encounter such anomalies like:

SCP-173 - Living concrete sculpture that can move only when not observed, killing people by snapping opponents' necks.
SCP-106 - Humanoid able to walk past matter, sending its prey to its Pocket Dimension.
SCP-079 - Self-evolving Artificial Intelligence, able to control facility control systems.
SCP-049 - Plague doctor trying to ""cure"" everyone he meets.
SCP-914 - Object improving machinery.",,1,"['Multiplayer', 'cooperative', 'Horror', 'Free to Play', 'Online multiplayer']",['Steam'],,['Hubert Moszka'],['Hubert Moszka'],2025-01-23T22:12:29,"{'yet': 131, 'owned': 2266, 'beaten': 44, 'toplay': 16, 'dropped': 192, 'playing': 21}"
Medieval II: Total War,"Medieval II: Total War is the sequel to the Medieval: Total War video game and it’s the fourth game in Total War series. The game is set between the years 1080 and 1530. It focuses on medieval warfare, religion and politics in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. There, similar to previous games in the series, are two modes of play: battles which can be played in multiplayer, in user-defined scenarios or in historical scenarios which simulates real battles of history like Battle of Arsuf or the Battle of Agincourt and the single-player campaign which lets the player build his civilization to conquer other factions. In large maps of the campaign, the player has to control the faction’s military, economic and social systems. When it's the player's turn, he has to move his army anywhere on the map, while in combat, the player has to choose either to fight the battle or let the computer calculate the outcome.

Planetary Annihilation,"Set in the distant future, this science fiction strategy was inspired by Total Annihilation (1997) and is designed by one of the original game's engine creators, Jon Mavor. Planetary Annihilation gameplay is largely similar to classic RTS series like Starcraft or Command & Conquer, yet not without its own unique features. This game is focused on interplanetary wars on a larger scale and allows its players to conquer the whole worlds or even destroy them using nukes and Death Star-like devices. The maps are randomly generated, and each map constitutes a whole planet in 3D projection (albeit scaled down). Each player starts with a Commander unit that is used to create necessary buildings. Commanders represent the player and, like in chess, loss of your Commander means losing the game.

The definitive feature of the game is that battles are not contained to certain planets, but are fought across the whole planetary systems using missiles and ""planet thrusters""; and there are many such systems in the galaxy. The scale of the setting can make it difficult to keep track of one's operations across different systems at the later stages of the game.",62.0,7,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Co-op', 'Sci-fi', 'Sandbox', 'Tactical', 'Cross-Platform Multiplayer', 'Space', 'Futuristic', 'RTS', 'Robots', 'Stylized', 'Kickstarter', 'Grand Strategy', 'Real-Time', 'Crowdfunded']",['Steam'],,['Uber Entertainment'],['Uber Entertainment'],2025-04-03T23:10:14,"{'yet': 124, 'owned': 2387, 'beaten': 35, 'toplay': 12, 'dropped': 104, 'playing': 2}"

Realm of the Mad God,"Realm of the Mad God is a multiplayer-only cooperative game in which teams of players hunt for monsters. The game uses a minimalistic retro-pixelated visual style with very simple animations. 

###Plot
According to the game's backstory, the mad god Oryx kidnapped the protagonists and transported them to his dark dimension. He is going to use them as food for his hordes of monsters. However, the protagonists have weapons, and they will fight back.

###Gameplay
Most of the gameplay consists of slaying monsters with a fantasy version of firearms. The game uses the top-down third-person view. The player controls his or her character with the use of a keyboard (for movement) and a mouse (for aiming). 

The central part of each server is Nexus, a safe zone in which the players can trade. From Nexus they teleport to various realms where they receive quests that involve killing monsters. When they kill enough monsters, they may encounter a boss, and eventually Oryx himself.

###Characters
There are fifteen character classes, but the new player has to start with only Wizard class available. Other classes that include Ninja, Samurai, Paladin, and Assassin, among others, will be eventually unlocked when the player gains more experience. 

An unusual feature of the Realm of the Mad God is the permanent death. When the player's character is killed, he or she will not respawn.

Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams,"Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is the third game in the series that was started by Giana Sisters, a 1987 platformer. The original game was a Super Mario rip-off, but, though the new game retained many of the old mechanics (such as defeating enemies by jumping on them), there are also novel gameplay ideas.
You play as Giana, a girl who tries to rescue her sister Maria from the hands of an evil dragon Gurglewocky. Giana herself has two different personalities, a ""Cutie"" and a ""Punk"", that can be switched during the game. This change also dramatically alters the environment, allowing the player to shift between two dream worlds: one is a brightly colored garden, while other is a dark, nightmarish forest of giant mushrooms. In both worlds, the levels are nearly identical, despite the aesthetic change. But sometimes the game may demand you to switch to another world to move forward or to obtain a powerup that only exists in one of the worlds.
A definitive feature of Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is its music. The score was composed by Chris Hulsbeck, who worked with the original Giana Sisters, and metal band Machinae Supremacy. The soundtrack shifts between “traditional” and ""heavy"" versions of the same compositions to highlight the game's dual nature.",77.0,3,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Multiplayer', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Cloud', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Great Soundtrack', '2D', 'Fantasy', 'Difficult', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Female Protagonist', 'Split Screen', 'Local Co-Op', 'Controller', 'Local Multiplayer', 'controller support', 'Side Scroller', 'Kickstarter', '2.5D']","['Epic Games', 'PlayStation Store', 'GOG', 'Steam', 'Nintendo Store', 'Xbox 360 Store']",,['Black Forest Games'],"['HandyGames', 'Black Forest Games', 'bitComposer Entertainment']",2025-04-14T21:29:51,"{'yet': 160, 'owned': 2339, 'beaten': 36, 'toplay': 19, 'dropped': 89, 'playing': 8}"
BIT.TRIP RUNNER,"In the fourth part of Bit.Trip series the player controls Commander Video, a small featureless character, as he runs eternally to the right through a pixelated landscape. He jumps and slides to evade dangers, such as giant caterpillars, angry trees or soaring fireballs, and kicks to attack them. He has no hit points, and any hit means you have to restart the level again. Commander Video always runs, the player cannot stop or reverse the movement and is only able to make the character perform certain actions, such as jumps, at the necessary moments. 
Commander Video's movements are perfectly synchronized to music. When movements are performed right, new notes are added to the game's chiptune music score. Even pushing an unassigned button will result in playing some musical sounds. The run becomes quicker with time, raising the game's difficulty, but also giving the player more control and influence over the soundtrack.

The Sims 3,"The Sims 3 is the third part of its series. Like all Sims game, it allows the player to control the life of a person or even a whole family.

###Character creation
Before the main game starts, the player has to create his or her character, called sim. The player can choose to play as a single character or a family. The game allows full customization for each sim. The player chooses their gender, age, race, and body type, as well as their traits that influence the sim's in-game behavior. The traits help sims to learn new skills that will be useful in their job and social life. The player can also choose to set all settings to random. There are also settings that define if the sims will age, and how fast.

###Gameplay
The game introduces the open world that lives on its own even when the player doesn't interfere. Unlike in Sims 2, the world is seamless and there's no long load time when you travel it. The sims themselves became more independent and require less player attention to stay alive. Sims 3 is less oriented towards ""tamagotchi""-like life-sustaining and more towards actually living the sims' lives, such as going to work, attending parties, making friends and flirting. The sims will occasionally have wishes, and fulfilling them earns the character more happiness points.

Hand of Fate,"Hand of Fate is an unusual combination of various genres. It is based on mechanics typical for deck-building board games, but also features rogue-like and hack-and-slash elements. Its approach to the storytelling is typical for tabletop RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons. 
You play cards against the Dealer, who is both your DM, opponent, and narrator of your adventures. Each card represents an item, a character, or an encounter. You navigate your character through the story that unfurls as you reveal the cards and make your choices. The goal is to collect a powerful deck of cards that give your character better weapons, armor, and other equipment. You can unlock more cards after you defeat bosses and complete quests. The Dealer’s goal is to hamper your progress, as he plays his cards to put new obstacles in your way.
Most of the time the game will only show you the cards and the Dealer who sits across the table from you. You will learn the events from listening to him and reading the text on cards. Battles, however, are actually fought in real time by animated characters on visualized 3D arenas. This is very unusual for board game simulators and brings some variety into the gameplay.",78.0,4,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Cloud', 'Atmospheric', 'steam-trading-cards', 'RPG', 'Third Person', 'Fantasy', 'Difficult', 'Steam Leaderboards', 'Action RPG', 'Hack and Slash', 'controller support', 'Roguelike', ""Beat 'em up"", 'Roguelite', 'Dungeon Crawler', 'Card Game', 'Choose Your Own Adventure', 'Board Game']","['PlayStation Store', 'Steam', 'GOG', 'Xbox Store']",,['Defiant Development'],['Defiant Development'],2025-05-05T01:54:25,"{'yet': 116, 'owned': 2151, 'beaten': 152, 'toplay': 35, 'dropped': 153, 'playing': 33}"

Night in the Woods,"Night in the Woods is a quest game developed by Infinite Fall.

###Plot
Night in the Woods takes place in a universe of anthropomorphic animals. A cat named May returns back to her hometown of Possum Springs because of a dissociative disorder that does not let her recognize other people something other than rectangular shapes. May had dropped out of college and she does not know what to do with her life yet. She got back into the town to hang out with her old friends or simply walk around the town and meet the people she knew in her childhood, yet this childhood world is no more. The city's residents start talking about something happening in the nearby forest. May gets her friends together and goes out to figure out what's going on.

The game explores the typical teenage problems in a common environment, as stated by the game's developers.

###Gameplay
The main objective of the game is to explore the in-game world. May can run, jump, and interact with both other characters and the in-game objects. As stated by the developers, the key actions the player should take are to explore, converse, see and touch. The game focuses mostly on its narrative, rather on the gameplay experience. 

While talking to other characters, the players can choose the line for May to reply with. Your replies will affect the game's story, yet the change will be minor.",88.0,6,"['Singleplayer', 'Full controller support', 'Atmospheric', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Story Rich', '2D', 'Horror', 'Funny', 'Exploration', 'Female Protagonist', 'controller support', 'Cute', 'Mystery', 'Colorful', 'Side Scroller', 'Walking Simulator', 'overlay', 'Drama', 'Kickstarter', 'cloud saves']","['PlayStation Store', 'Steam', 'GOG', 'Xbox Store', 'Nintendo Store', 'itch.io', 'Epic Games', 'App Store']",Teen,"['Finji', 'bombsfall', 'InfiniteAmmo', 'Infinite Fall']",['Finji'],2025-05-10T17:08:09,"{'yet': 287, 'owned': 1213, 'beaten': 552, 'toplay': 325, 'dropped': 163, 'playing': 85}"
Lucius,"06.06.1966 - an unusual number of sixes on this date, perhaps, somehow affected the character of one boy, born that day - Lucius. And certainly his character was influenced by the fact that his father is Lucifer himself, who on the sixth day after birth informed the boy that he had prepared many gifts for him. But to get these gifts, the boy needs a little work. Namely - to finish off everyone who lives with the boy in the same house or just inappropriately appeared next to him. This is a lot of people - twenty. Most different, from butlers and gardeners to reporters, priests and police. Papa Lucifer did not make any special demands, he was soft with his son - he did not order any special methods of murder, he agreed to any. But life is unpredictable, and the boy had to often retreat from simple scenarios, acting very ingeniously. On the other hand, he already had some of the unusual gifts - for example, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, the ability to subordinate someone else's will.",59.0,4,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Cloud', 'Atmospheric', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Story Rich', 'Open World', 'Third Person', 'Horror', 'Funny', 'Gore', 'Difficult', 'Stealth', 'Dark', 'Point & Click', 'Nudity', 'Mature', 'Villain Protagonist']","['GOG', 'Steam']",Adults Only,['Shiver Games'],['Shiver Games'],2025-05-22T21:07:18,"{'yet': 125, 'owned': 2185, 'beaten': 166, 'toplay': 33, 'dropped': 110, 'playing': 5}"

A new terrorist organization known as Viper Circle emerges. The group seeks world domination by eliminating political figures and executing terrorist attacks. A group of peacemakers opposing them.

###Gameplay
In Black Squad players engage in competitive team versus team matches in a variety of game modes. As in most free-to-play shooters, the game features an in-game shop where players can buy skins for their guns as well as experience point boosters and loot boxes for the in-game currency. This currency can be earned either by participating in the game's matches or it can be purchased for real money. The in-game shop does not affect the gameplay in any way, as only cosmetic items can be purchased just like in Overwatch or Rainbow Six: Siege.

Black Squad offers a variety of competitive multiplayer modes, such as Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, VIP Escort, Bomb Defusal, and a unique mode of Base Destruction, in which two teams of 16 players fight each other to destroy the enemy base.

The standard loadout system is present in the game with the players being able to carry one main weapon, one sidearm, one lethal and one non-lethal grenade, and a knife.

Dungeon Siege 3,"In Dungeon Siege III, 150 years have passed since the ending of the original Dungeon Siege. Some 30 years ago, a woman named Jeyne Kassynder led the rebellion and took over the power in the fantasy realm of Ehb. Kassynder framed the heroic 10th Legion, featured in Dungeon Siege, for the murder of the king, and nearly annihilated them.
The player takes the role of an heir to one of the last surviving Legion members. There are four possible protagonists with pre-scripted backstories to choose from, and the main plot will slightly differ based on your choice. However, regardless of which character you choose, the other three will eventually appear in the game and can be recruited to accompany the player, one at a time.
Each character has his or her unique set of skills and attacks. For example, Lucas, a knight, can withstand heavy damage in a melee fight. Katarina prefers ranged weapons and a little magic. Anjali is a shape-shifter who is a combination of both, depending on her current form, and Reinhart is a classic magician who uses energy spells.

Her three friends come together on her funeral and tell three stories about her recent adventures that did not appear in previous games. These three stories take the most of the game’s playtime. 

###Gameplay 
The gameplay shares many similarities with Last Revelation. The levels in the game incorporate platforming, puzzle solving and fighting enemies. Lara can use many different weapons in combat such as her iconic double pistols with infinite ammo, submachine guns, shotguns, harpoon guns. The new item to the series is grappling gun. It can fire grappling hook that clings on certain surfaces and produces a rope that can be used to swing across rooms and get over pits. 
Platforming sequences require Lara to use different acrobatic moves like somersaults, walking the tightrope, swinging on horizontal bars.

The gameplay, on the other hand, is quite memorable: in fact so crucial that not only Worms have given birth to many other worms-like games but also created a whole genre: artillery tactical turn-based strategy. The primary goal of a team or a player is to eliminate the opponent(s). To achieve this goal, one must utilize a various range of weapons.

After the events of the second game, all three heroes had their time to rest, but now, after they answered a new call, the prisoner of the Artifacts, Sarek, has broken out and is planning to corrupt the world with his magic.

Tacoma,"Tacoma is an indie adventure game developed by Fullbright.

###Story
In 2088, corporations heavily influence social life. These conglomerates are the pioneers of space travel, space construction, and artificial intelligence development. The economy promoting loyalty to a select corporation is established. 

The game takes place on the Tacoma space station. It serves as a transit hub between Earth and a resort built upon Moon. Amy Ferrier is hired by the corporation that operates the station to investigate a mysterious chain of events occurred on the station and to retrieve a processing module from the station's artificial intelligence. Upon her arrival, Amy begins to find out what's going on using Tacoma's augmented reality system.

###Gameplay
Tacoma focuses on the in-game world's exploration. There are no enemies present in the game, so the players can focus on the narrative aspect of it. 

The players utilize an augmented reality device found on the station to access its security footage and recreate the events that happened here. It is possible to manipulate the footage like a recording, fast-forwarding it, pausing and rewinding. The players can see the characters move from room to room, or in some cases follow the character's path. One of the main game's aspects is its puzzles, as it is the main thing the players will be doing for most of the time.",78.0,4,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Full controller support', 'Horror', 'Walking Simulator', 'LGBTQ+']","['PlayStation Store', 'Steam', 'GOG', 'Xbox Store', 'Epic Games']",Mature,['Fullbright'],['The Fullbright Company'],2025-03-12T19:22:47,"{'yet': 289, 'owned': 1863, 'beaten': 286, 'toplay': 90, 'dropped': 45, 'playing': 10}"
Sunless Sea,"###The help from Kickstarter backers
This is a role-playing game with roguelike elements from the independent British studio Failbetter Games. The money was collected on Kickstarter, just 4 271 backers supported the game, and donated a little over a hundred thousand pounds to its development. The game is available for solo completion on PC, Mac, and Linux.

###Story and setting
The player tries on the role of the captain of the ship. Captain's backstory is fully customizable. The game is a spin-off for the browser game Fallen London from the same developers: the action takes place in the same universe and at the same time. The game mixes the Victorian era and the mystical atmosphere of Lovecraft's books. The player sails between different islands of the underground sea, facing different dangers. To win, you need to achieve a certain goal: for example, to find a treasure or to gain the title of the most famous seafarer by transporting goods and opening new lands.

###Key Features

In addition to mundane enemies, the alien race of Ceph threatens humanity who pursues its goals. The player gains control of Prophet - a soldier in nano suit, whose primary goal is to stop the leader of the alien race.

Turning into a jungle landscape one of the most recognizable cities in the world, allowed developers to diversify the gameplay.

The Council,"The Complete Season of The Council grants you access to all 5 episodes.
The Council is an episodic game like no other. Delivering a fresh new take on the Narrative Adventure, your choices and character growth truly matter. Make hard-hitting decisions, but also develop an array of skills to directly impact how the story unfolds. With permanent, long-lasting consequences, there is no going back. Plunge into a tale of intrigue and manipulation in the style of a classic murder mystery, living with a cast of alluring characters each hiding their own dark secrets. Trust no one while uncovering dire truths – no matter the cost to mind and body.
The Council begins in 1793, with players taking the role of secret society member Louis de Richet after his invitation to a private island off the shores of England by the enigmatic Lord Mortimer. Joining him are a number of high profile guests, including Napoleon Bonaparte and President of the newly-formed United States of America, George Washington. The strange nature of this private reception goes beyond just the prestigious guests –Richet’s own mother has recently gone missing on the island, while each and every one of the colorful cast seems to have their own hidden agendas.
In a new twist for the genre, the core of The Council’s gameplay comes from manipulating and maneuvering through character encounters using the unique Social Influence system. During confrontations, skills and limited resources can be used to gain the upper hand and achieve the desired outcome. Players will be rewarded for their knowledge of each character’s psychological vulnerabilities and immunities, as well as their preparations made during prior exploration and investigation. Failing an encounter does not mean ‘game over’, and no action can be taken back. The consequences are permanent, and may result in persistent physical disfigurements or mental traits that help or hinder the rest of the player’s adventure.
Richet’s numerous skills can be developed to align with your chosen approach to the adventure. Solve issues with diplomacy, delve into occultism to expand your historical and scientific knowledge, or play detective and see what others do not perceive. Your skills will have uses that extend far beyond your conversations with fellow guests. With 15 diverse skills to use and invest in, players are free to uncover The Council’s mysteries how they see fit, with wildly varying consequences depending on their methods. The results will forever alter the life of Louis de Richet, of those around him, and shape history as we know it.",76.0,4,"['Singleplayer', 'Full controller support', 'Steam Cloud', 'Atmospheric', 'RPG', 'Story Rich', 'Horror', 'Violent', 'Point & Click', 'Nudity', 'Mystery', 'Choices Matter', 'Historical', 'Detective', 'Episodic', 'Illuminati']","['GOG', 'PlayStation Store', 'Steam', 'Xbox Store']",Mature,['Big Bad Wolf'],['Focus Home Interactive'],2025-03-25T03:51:46,"{'yet': 163, 'owned': 1942, 'beaten': 197, 'toplay': 173, 'dropped': 70, 'playing': 32}"

His cyborg girlfriend Goal got into trouble because of Rufus’s faults, and he has to save her. The plot, character interactions, and many jokes rely on the assumption that the player is already familiar with most characters from Deponia. However, in case you didn’t play the original game, there’s an introduction to familiarize you.
Chaos on Deponia uses point-and-click controls, which are usually better suited for mouses and keyboards. However, the developers claim to make sure that playing with a console’s controller is just as fluid and natural. The analog stick stands in for the mouse, while the buttons control various actions Rufus can do to objects and other characters.

Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising,"Dragon Rising is the second installment of Operation Flashpoint series, though its plot bears no connection to the previous game. The game is set on Skira, a fictional Northern Pacific island with huge oil reserves. China annexed the island, provoking a military conflict with Russia and the US. Skira’s landscape is thoroughly modeled after a real-life Kiska island in Russia. 
The player assumes the role of a leader in a squad of four US soldiers, three of which are AI-controlled. In the single-player campaign, they perform a series of military operations against the Chinese army. The gameplay tries to authentically simulate the real warfare, with no checkpoints and few scripted scenes. Depending on the difficulty level, the player may even lack the traditional HUD indications of health, ammo, and directions. The player will have to march long distances through the 35 km wide Skira, which may feel like a slog, but also adds to the game’s realism.

Call of Cthulhu,"Call of Cthulhu: The Official Video Game is a psychological horror game adapted from the 1981 tabletop role-playing game of the same name by Chaosium. It is loosely based on the famous horror story by H. P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos universe in general.

###Plot
The game is set in 1924 in Massachusetts, USA. The main character is Edward Pierce, a troubled and alcoholic private detective. He was hired to investigate the mysterious fire that destroyed the Hawkins mansion on the Darkwater Island and killed the Hawkins family. Shortly before the fire, the mother of the family drew an image of a weird monster. Pierce's investigation eventually leads him to discover the secret cult of the ancient evil god Cthulhu, who is about to awaken to unleash his rage on Earth. The protagonist faces cosmic horrors, unholy cultists, weird dimensions, and otherworldly creatures that make him question his own sanity.

###Gameplay
The player controls Edward Pierce and navigates him across the Darkwater Island. The goal is to investigate the case by talking to other characters, searching for clues and exploring the environment. The protagonist is weak and cannot really fight a strong opponent, so the player has to find the ways to avoid trouble. Another major concern in the game is sanity. Encountering eldritch abominations and uncovering dark secrets can drive Edward insane.

Kentucky Route Zero,"At twilight in Kentucky, as bird songs give way to the choir of frogs and insects, familiar roads become strange, and it's easy to get lost. Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip.

KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.

Originally published episodically over a span of years, the game now includes all five acts along with the ""interludes,"" which were originally published separately. It has also been painstakingly localized for French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish and Latin American).",81.0,2,"['Singleplayer', 'Full controller support', 'Atmospheric', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Story Rich', '2D', 'Horror', 'Exploration', 'Point & Click', 'Mystery', 'Surreal', 'Kickstarter', 'Episodic', 'Interactive Fiction', 'Einzelspieler', 'artsy']","['App Store', 'Steam', 'GOG', 'itch.io']",Teen,"['Netflix', 'Cardboard Computer']","['Annapurna Interactive', 'Netflix', 'Cardboard Computer']",2025-05-02T18:16:44,"{'yet': 254, 'owned': 1561, 'beaten': 188, 'toplay': 337, 'dropped': 127, 'playing': 66}"

Emily is Away,"Emily is Away is an indie-developed visual novel created by Kyle Seeley. 

###Plot
The game tells the story of the main character relationship with a girl named Emily which lasted for five years and began in the early 2000s. 

###Gameplay
Unlike most visual novels, this game is linear, with the players being unable to influence the plot development severely. The game resembles an online chat using an EOL messaging client running on an operating system that closely resembles Windows XP. There are multiple pop-culture references to the early 2000s era, such as the user profile icons, that resemble multiple old memes (like the Polish Polka), the icons on the main character's desktop that show that he is a fan of 28 Days Later, Lord of The Rings, and Red Hot Chili Peppers. 

As the game goes on, the players are able to change their profile icon according to the tendencies of these years. It is also possible to interact not only with Emily, but also with their classmates, and the main player's friends. The main gameplay revolves around chatting with emilyluv (she will later change her nickname to emerly). You discuss your high school love with her and your classmate Brad that harasses Emily. It turns out that your other classmate, Travis, is planning a party, which the players can choose to attend with Emily or stay at home.",,1,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Story Rich', '2D', 'Funny', 'Free to Play', 'Pixel Graphics', 'Retro', 'Short', 'Choices Matter', 'Visual Novel', 'Illuminati', 'Romance', 'Choose Your Own Adventure', 'Dating Sim', 'Interactive Fiction', 'Text-Based']",['Steam'],,['Kyle Seeley'],['Kyle Seeley'],2025-03-25T03:55:33,"{'yet': 83, 'owned': 1926, 'beaten': 452, 'toplay': 15, 'dropped': 49, 'playing': 3}"

###Gameplay 
Like other TrackMania entries, Nations is a racing game with heavy emphasis on player-made content and simplified physics. There is only one car available in the game, which gives every player equal opportunities and accentuates the importance of skill over the right car choice or tuning.
The single-player component consists of 100 tracks that gradually get more and more difficult. There is no collision system in the game, so other players or AI opponents do not affect your car’s movement. Depending on the time it took to finish the race, the player gets bronze, silver, or gold medal. Different tracks require a certain amount of medal to unlock. 
Each of the single-player tracks is available for multiplayer alongside the custom tracks that are made with in-game track-editor.

The game's plot seems loosely connected to the base game as id Software was busy with developing Quake. The simply players set out on a journey to kill off four guardians of hell. This episode serves as a prequel to Doom 2.

###Gameplay
Minor additions were made to Doom's engine, as it now featured several Doom 2's engine features, such as the ability to use flickering lights and fast working doors. Apart from that, the game is still the base Doom. 

Players traverse vast levels killing any Hell creature they encounter on their way. A wide range of weapons is as the player's disposal, starting with a brass knuckle and finishing with an experimental energy weapon, BFG9000.

The one and only objective of the player is to find the exit of the level. Sometimes a keycard is required to unlock the exit. Upon the completion of the level, the player's performance is evaluated and points are accumulated based on how fast did the player pass the level, how ruthless they did it, how many demons got killed and how many secrets were found. 

At the end of each episode, the players will encounter a Boss - a unique and powerful enemy that has to be defeated to complete the level.",,1,"['Singleplayer', 'Multiplayer', 'Steam Cloud', 'Great Soundtrack', 'First-Person', 'Sci-fi', 'Horror', 'FPS', 'Gore', 'Difficult', 'Classic', 'Violent', 'Retro', 'Zombies', 'Moddable', 'Fast-Paced', ""1990's"", '2.5D', 'Demons']","['Steam', 'GOG']",Mature,"['id Software', 'Nerve Software', 'Lion Entertainment']","['Bethesda Softworks', 'Activison', 'id Software', 'GT Interactive Software', 'GT Interactive', 'Active Software']",2025-05-05T16:43:14,"{'yet': 80, 'owned': 2108, 'beaten': 232, 'toplay': 27, 'dropped': 59, 'playing': 17}"

Crysis 2,"The sequel to Crysis is set three years after the original. All events of the 2020 incident, especially the human-alien conflict, were kept secret, and CryNet Systems is hunting for survivors of the first contact. However, the extraterrestrial race of Ceph did not give up its plans on the Earth. Crysis 2 introduces the new protagonist, a US Marine codenamed Alcatraz. Prophet, the squad leader from Crysis, also makes an appearance, and his recorded memories guide Alcatraz as he uncovers the alien plot. As in every game of the series, the protagonist is armed with a futuristic Nano Muscle Suit, a military exoskeleton that adsorbs damage, heals and strengthens the wearer. The suits were updated since Crysis, introducing modules for suit customization and a new Tactical mode. The player can now use multiple suit modes at the same time. 
Most levels are set in the urban environment this time to distinguish the game from the original.

The Escapists,"The Escapists is an indie adventure game with role-playing and puzzle elements developed by Mouldy Toof Studios.

###Gameplay
You play as a prisoner with only one goal in mind - escape. The players can acquire items that will help them in the process of escaping either by buying them from fellow prisoners or crafting them. In fact, you can always steal the items you need from someone else.

It is possible to interact with other inmates who can assign tasks to the player. By completing these quests, the players can increase their respect or earn some money. Different activities such as visiting the gym or reading in the library increase the player's stats which increase the chances of a successful escape. 

In order for the player to not be spotted by their wardens, it is essential to avoid their attention and follow the timetable by eating food with all the other inmates, appearing at a morning gathering, and so on. The cells are often searched, so the player has to be careful and hide the tools required for the escape. If one should get detected, they're moved to the punishment cell and lose all the items and preparations they made for the escape.

Pony Island,"###Arcade soul
Game by the authorship of one person: Daniel Mullins. The developer conceived it as an interactive arcade machine, which was called Pony Island. According to the idea, the player soon learns that the machine is infected with a certain demon, which captures the souls of players.

###Key features
The main character gets help from the soul of a player already captured: he could not cope with the devil's trials. Pony Island is a point-and-click game that simulates the operating system using the user interface. The main task of the player is to study the internal software shell of the gaming machine, where he got stuck and tried to escape the demon. The gameplay of the game changes constantly and the player needs to participate in mini-games like endless runner and shoot-em-up.

###Money for the dream
Prior to Pony Island, Daniel Mullins was already trying to release the game: right after college, in 2014, he collected the necessary money to develop his first game Catch Monsters. The successful crowdfunding experience allowed Daniel to pursue his dream and not work on boring work in the office. Pony Island was developed in just 48 hours, during the Ludum Game Jam, and later appeared on the platform for indie games Steam Greenlight. After that, the popular YouTube PewDiePie recorded and published a let's play of the game, after which the game gained enough votes, and a full release happened.",86.0,3,"['Singleplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Atmospheric', 'steam-trading-cards', 'Great Soundtrack', 'Story Rich', '2D', 'Horror', 'Funny', 'Gore', 'Pixel Graphics', 'stats', 'Dark', 'Cute', 'Short', 'Memes', 'Demons', 'Hacking', 'Experimental', 'Horses']","['Steam', 'Xbox Store']",,['Daniel Mullins Games'],['Daniel Mullins Games'],2025-05-05T21:31:50,"{'yet': 129, 'owned': 1926, 'beaten': 324, 'toplay': 36, 'dropped': 68, 'playing': 10}"
Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime,"In Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, the player assumes control over the crew of a pixelated spaceship. Your goal is to navigate it through the dangerous 2D space, avoid asteroids and fight off enemy ships and space monsters. Every time the ship hits an object, it loses some of its health. 
The spaceship contains several devices, such as thrusters, laser cannons, and deflector shields, and one character can only control one device at a time. To keep the ship running and safe, the protagonists have to constantly move around the ship to activate a certain device. This is why, although Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime can also be played alone, the game is strongly oriented towards the cooperative multiplayer. Up to four players can participate and form a crew to thoroughly control every device.
